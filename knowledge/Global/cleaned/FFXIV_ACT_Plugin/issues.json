Here's a log with debug network logging turned on and me doing various things that you can see from ChatLog lines (sightseeing vista, crafting, countdown, countdown cancel, zone seal).There's only 6 SystemLogMessage lines.Two for \"you synthesized\", one for \"proof of completion in crafting log\".And then three for zone will be sealed, zone is sealed, zone is unsealed.I would expect quite a few more, as all of those activities above exist in the LogMessage table.Mostly my concern is that it'd be nice to switch from ChatLog lines to SystemLogMessage lines, especially since people seem to turn chat logs off or use dalamud plugins that muck with them.However, it seems unreliable? (Or maybe I'm misunderstanding?)If it was just the text that appears in bubbles on screen (vs in the chat log only), then I would also expect to see stuff like https://xivapi.com/LogMessage/4676?pretty=true appear in line 41 as well.I think this would help address #264 if it could be used more reliably.Sorry for any misunderstanding about how this is supposed to work.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: All reactions"

The thing is the 2nd step in my melee combo did not appear in the ACT logs one time. This threw me off a lot, and I verified at the time that my 3rd combo step was highlighted on my bars.Later I went back and verified that:Searching thru the ACT logs of the encounter, the log line of interest is missing.There are 11 \"You use Enchanted Riposte\"There are 10 \"You use Enchanted Zwerchhau\"There are 11 \"You use Enchanted Redoublement\"And at 21:09 in the logs there is a sequence of Enchanted Riposte and Redoublement, without the Zwerchhau in between.Going back in my Battle Log in FFXIV, the log line of interest is there (I used timestamps to find the combo). In my FFXIV logs, the Enchanted Zwercchau usage is present at 21:09.I could provide the ACT log, though I'm not sure if that's useful as the line is not there.I'm concerned if lines are dropped occasionally that this will make triggers unreliable.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: All reactions"

I supposed only crit, only direct hit and both?I also looked into the Options under Encounter View Options, no \"Crit%\" option there.Unsure if it is a bug or just me.On a slightly offtopic note but related to this, I want to fix my overlay but I'm not sure what variables the new things use.

So, this feature will only really be useful in network mode.If you'd be willing, send me an email to ravahn(at)Hotmail.com and when I code the option, I'll send it to you first to review and see if it works how you expect.In regards to DoT damage lines in the combat log, it is not possible to break this out into separate log lines for each player's portion of the damage.Each log line contains the combined DoT tick on a target, and the game does not send the individual ticks to the client.That's why the plugin has a DoT 'simulator', since it needs to estimate the per-player/per-DoT damage.The victim is included in the DoT lines already, though.After it is parsed, the log text should look something like:[14:14:20.493] 18:DoT Tick on Karlabos for 183 damage.

It crashes every single time. and I can tell it's happening as soon as I Alt-Tab or click back to it, because I can see ACT on my second monitor with the timer counting up from an encounter, and as soon as I switch to it the timer hangs and it becomes unresponsive until I kill the process.This has actually been happening for a while, and isn't something that's new to either this version of ACT or the plugin.

I just moved it out of the system drive to make sure it works this time).Run it and click \"yes\" to the update prompt. Now it should update itself (to the same version tho).Now you can either close this duplicated version and delete it (the old version won't ask to update) or you can keep using it as you'll propably face the same issue with every next version due to windows being windows.The other way to solve it would be to somehow deal with the permission issue on ACT folder but I have no clue how permissions work on windows.

All other fonts will no longer be present for that overly, however the other overlays will still have access to all of the other fonts just fine.The only fix I've found so far, is to close ACT, navigate to the FFXIV_ACT_Plugin.config.xml in the AppData directory and manually editing the font for the affected overlay to something else (such as Arial), and then relaunching ACT, and the full font list is there again.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: All reactions"

Would it be terribly difficult to properly account for an calculate the total potency inflicted to all targets? Also, it should properly handle moves like Standard Finish, which deal 1000 potency to the first target, and 750 to all others.Many thanks!The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: All reactions"

It's entirely possible that it could work on Mac, but someone on Mac with a lot of technical knowledge would have to put in the effort to get it to work.Here's a quick list of the requirements:I think it's generally required that you be running the DX11 version of FFXIV, and I have no idea if that's the case for Mac. If not, or if Mac has its own executables running in its wine environment that only exist for Mac, the plugin won't ever work for Mac.Must be able to run ACT within the same wine prefix and wine server that FFXIV is runningMust be able to install .NET Framework into the FFXIV wine prefix at least to 4.5 for ACT to work, but more realistically all the way to 4.7.2 for additional plugins to workACT process must be able to read FFXIV process memory. No clue what the security implications would be on Mac for this.ACT process must be able to open a raw socket connection to accept the same packets that the FFXIV process receives. Again, no clue what the security implications are for Mac for this. On Linux, we have to use the setcap program to set capabilities on the main wine executables and jump through a whole bunch of other hoops to make this work.The Linux setup is scripted out at my github for linux for reference.

This can be useful if you want to send your log files to another person, but don't want them to be able to see your /tell's, /fc chat, etc. This isn't applicable to most users, since most users are just using the plugin to display DPS locally or to upload to FFLogs, the latter of which strips the chat log lines from the file before sending it IIRC.Certain triggers and timeline syncs in Cactbot rely on the chat log lines, so checking the box to hide them can cause problems.

However, on the in-game UI, the cast bar is not done yet, indicating that there's something else driving or modifying the car bar.This has been an issue with certain fights. Here's examples I can think of off the top of my head:DSR: Thordan's \"Broad Swing\" at the end of P2 has a slightly longer cast bar in-game than reported in the log (IDs 0x63C0 and 63C1).P8S2: High Concept cast bars (0x79AC) are significantly longer than reported in the log.TOP: Seems there are a few here as well. e.g. see this note in Cactbot.Taking High Concept as an example:Initial cast, lists 4.7 seconds as the duration. Game files list it as 5.0 seconds which is typical (damage snapshot is usually 0.3 seconds after the castbar ends):20|2022-09-04T23:44:32.0070000+08:00|4001454C|Hephaistos|79AC|_rsv_31148|4001454C|Hephaistos|4.700|100.00|77.00|0.00|0.00|f14d42db7bac198cThat cast snapshots 5 seconds later, as expected from the 20-line.

                "content": "That seems reasonable. Seems to match up with my 3 examples.Onto implementation:For player abilities, you can generally trust the server-provided cast time. Deriving it from the data files would require their SpS/SkS to be known. The damage snapshot is 0.5 seconds before the end of the castbar i.e. slidecast window. I don't know if any player abilities behave differently or would have a non-zero value in that field.For enemy abilities, there's two snapshots - one at the end of the castbar, which is the \"were you standing in it\" snapshot, and then the damage is typically 0.3 seconds after that. The data file will report the longer duration - e.g. for a 2.7 second castbar, the damage will be applied at 3.0 seconds, and the data file lists 3.0 as the duration.So I think the cleanest way it could be implemented is:Check if it's a player abilityIf not, check if it has an \"extra duration\" or whatever we want to call that column.If so, add that onto the cast time.If it's in the plugin, it might make more sense as an extra field of some sort (either indicating you need to add it to the normal cast time, or just add it on the plugin side and have a field for \"visual cast time\"), since the \"cast time\" that we have right now is still potentially useful in some ways.Of course, it could also just be left up to downstream consumers.

I am not sure how that fits into this discussion, especially considering there is no consistent way to determine any of the types of snapshots you just brought up.Bringing up snapshots is partially to provide background information, but also to clarify that the actual cast bar time seems to be the packet cast time plus the extra from the unknown column in the EXD. You want to ignore the actual \"CastTime\" column in favor of the server-provided time, because that would also cause it to not match the visual castbar. The CastTime column typically corresponds to the difference between the S>C cast packet and S>C snapshot packet (but not 100% of the time, e.g. player abilities).I am assuming that what you are basically suggesting/wanting, is for the cast times of actions to show the time listed in the Action EXD rather than what's in the packet.Sort of. As I mentioned above, it would be something like \"packet cast time plus extra time from the unknown exd column\".Kind of OT now:This is only an estimate, and is variable for every cast from the player due to ping.I believe the discrepancy is accounted for if you consider only the S>C packets. The local client will visually start playing the cast before the server sends back the \"Okay, you're casting this now\" packet, which would cause it to be less than 0.5 seconds effectively.Understanding snapshots gets messy especially for things with multiple hidden actors where the \"real\" cast is coming from OR for things like A12 where the snapshot for sacrament is nearly a second after the cast bar in the UI.It depends. Many of these look something like this:Real boss starts cast bar (0.0s)Real boss finishes cast bar (2.7s)Real boss \"snapshots\" ability (3.0s) - 21-line with no actual effectsFake actor snapshots ability (3.Xs) - actual damage or whatever All reactions"

In fact it is counting it, just as a debuff/buff with no damage when I try to see what its simulated DoT is. (The damage adds up total I am pretty sure with the DoTs but if I open up with a Tri-Disaster and don't do any damage first then it doesn't count the DPS. But if I open with an attack of some sort then it will count.) . I know DoTs are iffy to get right but since patch and everything I've noticed my DPS dropping by at least almost as much as 1k in some situations and I know they didn't nerf SMN that much... Idk if it is just SMN class that this is happening to or what.It also is not tracking all of Bahamuts Wyrmwaves. It only tracks about a third of those which also looks like a DPS loss on ACT. I'm not sure if all this falls within the FFXIV Plugin or ACT itself but it needs to be looked into and fixed as soon as possible please. It's a little frustrating since I main a SMN and it starting to look like it cant pull it's own weight and is gimped which is bad so now I'm healing til its fixed =\\The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: All reactions"

Those errors are usually preceded by a couple lines saying something about receiving TCP packets in an unexpected order.I'm on a Wifi connection (wired not possible ATM) and the network is set to private. I'm using Win10 Pro without any third party firewall/antivirus software. ACT and FFXIV are both \"allowed\" for private networks in the Windows Firewall settings. ACT x64 is running as admin. I'm on a fairly new Optimus laptop, if that matters for anything.I tried setting the IP to my local IP (assigned by NAT router) specifically; the dropdown list also listed a loopback IP, so I thought maybe the All/Default setting might have gotten things confused. At first that seemed to help but the problem cropped up again halfway through Rabanastre. (During the chocobo/mimic part I believe; I imagine there is extremely heavy load there due to 24 people spamming AOEs on 8+ targets.)I also just now downloaded Win10Pcap and checked the box to use it in the ACT plugin; will update if that seems to help next time I play.

Some countries don't even use commas and periods; in Switzerland they would write 1'234.56.

That being said, I think there are a lot of ways they could be made better. Here are a couple of suggestions:Allow adding overlays for player resources (life, mana, tp)Instead of using the same color for the entire \"color bucket\", blend between the starting and stopping colors. That way we could make (multi-segmented) \"gradients\" of color. (Bonus points: Please convert the colors to linear light when blending!)For HP bars, allow customizing the bar based on the class/job of the target. This goes in line with how most other MMORPGs handle bars, which is IMO much more useful than just showing a green bar for everything.Allow adding party/alliance bars. These should ideally be roughly laid out the same way as the ingame party/raid bars, so we can just put them \"on top\" of the ingame ones (and make those have transparency 90%).In general, I think we should strive towards making a complete \"UI replacement\" that replaces as much of the horrible default UI by something closer to what ElvUI and friends do for WoW.Anyway, thanks for the great work. The new target bar alone makes this game much more playable!The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: All reactions"

I've considered retiring the overlays completely, but since there isnt anything out there yet to replace it, I've left them.Hopefully another developer would be willing to step in and create their own target overlay plugin.Player and mob targets can be read through the FFXIV_ACT_Plugin.Common.IDataRepository interface now, so all the necessary memory information is available with no need to write custom memory reading code.

I believe that it installs a kernel driver that can interfere with network packet capturing.If none of the above helps, can you email me a log file where you attack a training dummy to ravahn (at) hotmail.com?I'll take a look to see if there is anything helpful in there.Even better if you turn on the \"(DEBUG) Dump all Network Data to logfile\" option, but dont run with that on for more than a minute or two, since it may produce huge log files.As a last resort, if you disable network parsing (Plugins -> FFXIV Settings, \"Disable Parsing from Network Data\" checkbox), it should read data - however it will be slightly less accurate under high-load situations.

This is both a good thing (people can inspect the code if they are curious to make sure it is safe) and a bad thing (a few people have posted the source code without disclaimers/etc, potentially creating false branches, confusion, or hacked copies). But it does allow someone who is interested in helping to identify changed memory signatures and updated struct offsets. I welcome the help, but caution that it's quite complex to get it updated for both dx9 and dx11, and network parsing vs memory-only parsing. I do it myself, while also keeping an eye out to other groups on Discord and the updated offsets they find.Totally understandable. I have a large \"secret\" project that I've been working on for XIV, partially utilizing ACT as an optional info pathway, but mostly a fully DX-compliant overlay system that mocks the UI of the system and allows direct access to external resources and such. I couldn't imagine trying to explain all the nuances of that code to someone, haha. :) I'm just getting tired of having to tab out for things like websites and youtube videos, and I want it to look as natural as possible... so a homemade DX GUI was the path I took. However some of the things, like URL detection, need a parser to work since I'm not about to reinvent that wheel. I digress.Knowing it's un-obfuscated I suppose I could go that route, but I generally wouldn't do so unless the author permitted it, since I would hate for people to do that to mine. I'll keep that in mind for the future. All reactions"
