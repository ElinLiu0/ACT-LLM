When \"seeking\" within the enounter or starting from the beginning, initData is not called again.Additional informationIf initData is only called once, then this means any triggers which rely on initData to \"reset state\" will fail until reloading the encounter or changing character. For example, let's say a user has a data object that exists to collect a list of players with a specific status, and then a trigger is used later in the encounter based on that list. That list needs to be reset every pull in order for the trigger to work as intended. When emulating the encounter, the list does not get reset when \"rewinding\", so the trigger will only work as expected the first time that trigger fires.My current work around is to have an \"initialization trigger\" that performs the same actions as initData, but this feels redundant since it's only there for the raidemulator.As an aside, this is my first time using the raidemulator, so if there is something I am missing or it's likely to be on my end, feel free to close this issue.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

I had a list of items that needed fixing in the initial pull request. Several are still outstanding:1.Particle Beam Circles2. Hand Tethers3. Flameflow4. Atomos DetectionOn Particle Beams, I've isolated it to the log line[01:23:40.002] FB:Warning: 01:23:48.978 Ground AOE tick but cannot find buff ID [739]This consistently appears alongside the Particle Beam circles during both Scathach and Diabolos. My guess is this is something not currently supported in the ACT plugin?On hand tethers, I'm totally stumped. No 23 log lines appear unless the targeted person looks at the hand. Once they look at it, then the tether will change from 0001 to 0002 and back when they look away and back at it. It's baffling.Flameflow and Atomos are regex matching issues. On Atomos, the way things work is that Ferdiad targets himself and casts Wormhole. As he initiates the cast, the game summons 3 (in phase 1) or 4 (in phase 2) Atomos. Additionally, in phase 1 the game summons either an Aether or an Aetherial Chakram, and on phase 2 the game will summon 2 in any combination. This Aether/Chakram immediately tethers to the type of Atomos that has an even number and starts casting Juggling Sphere. At the end of the cast, the Aether/Chakram will swoop in, reappear at the untethered Atomos, and explode in either a circle or a donut.The relevant regex for Atomos is:/ 14:(\\y{AbilityCode}):\\y{Name} starts using Juggling Sphere on Wailing Atomos/And the trigger function is:if (matches[1] == '1C9F') or if (matches[1] == '1CA0')I feel like the problem is that I'm fundamentally misunderstanding exactly what the matches[x] syntax is returning. What I understood it to do is return the entire matched log line, in the case of matches[0], or the matched substring in the relevant match group, in the case of matches[1], as noted in the triggers readme. Clearly this is wrong, but I haven't had much luck trying to determine what is the case so far.I could just take the easy way out and write one trigger per possibility, but that's ridiculous. There's clearly a better way.A recent log from Dun Scaith.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

That's interesting stuff. I have a log with network capture now. I don't know what to look for here though, I haven't read through the documentation on network logs, so I'll have to find that and see what's what.You were correct, the primary issue I was having was not including the data object. Not sure why I was thinking it was an optional argument.I think I should have a pull request ready in a day or two that will take care of the Atomos section acceptably at least. There's a more elegant solution that would handle all four cases in one trigger, but I won't be at a place to do that for a while.Thanks so much for taking the time to look at this again.

I do have a Deathgaze enrage log,, and I think I have enough information to do a Ferdiad timeline.I may have enough of the encounter to do the second half of Scathach now, but her first half has several really odd phase pushes and I'm not sure where they are yet.

(There are some polyphonic characters in Japanese that cause problems, too, but significantly fewer than Chinese.)With a post-processor, we can do:replace polyphonic characters programmaticallyprefix/postfix some words that they like, to improving TTS, etc.replace some common words like \"East/South/West/North\" (some players prefer \"Up/Down/Left/Right\" even though that confuse with \"Move Left/Right of the Boss\") without touch a bunch of settings of triggers....The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

Given that we have infrastructure for NetRegex parsing already in place, it will be \"trivial\" to parse whatever we come up with. One of the nice things about the current structure is that it's very compact for a human reader, and it would be nice if we could mostly hold to that. \"CSV\"-style seems like it would make life harder if the source ever contains a separator, but it would definitely be the most compact.I wouldn't mind stuffing everything into the NetRegex object, but that would potentially consume a lot of horizontal space. If we're willing to accept that timelines may just end up being wide, however, that's not really a concern. If we do want to keep horizontal space contained, I would vote for option 2, \"keyword per line\".Since this is already going to be a breaking change, we might also want to think about changes to how timeline keywords are handled. For instance, maybe we could split window out into windowBefore and windowAfter. I would like to start enforcing a deliberate keyword order regardless, so that, say, window parameters are always before jumps or loops if they exist. (This might need to be a stylistic thing only, but it would still be nice.) "

I have not used Cactbot yet, but I have experienced this \"lag\" with the other plugin. This problem is difficult to replicate.

I am only commenting here because I realize I also have a 144hz 1440p monitor, similar to OP.Relevant PC specs:Main monitor 144hz 1440p (where I run FFXIV)2nd monitor 60hz 1080p (where I run ACT)Neither monitor has Freesync or GsyncGame FPS settings capped at 144hzNvidia GeForce GTX 1080 TIWindows 10These facts made me think to Google the problem to see if it is unrelated to FFXIV and ACT. I managed to find these posts:https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/5o32vs/psa_for_people_with_144hz_60hz_dual_monitor_with/https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/7h9bnu/psafor_people_with_dual_monitors_with_different/I have only recently noticed this issue because I took a break from FFXIV for over a year and just started playing again. In the meantime, I upgraded to this new 144hz monitor.In my opinion, this is probably a result of running ACT on a 60hz 2nd monitor while having the overlays displaying on another monitor with higher refresh rate (which is neither 60hz or 120hz) but ACT still trying to render the overlay at 60hz, causing applications on the main monitor to occasionally drop FPS to compensate.The overlay should be forced to run at the framerate of the monitor where the overlays are being displayed. This may be something ACT itself would need to fix, not sure if it is in the scope of a plugin.In the meantime, I recommend applying some of the \"fixes\" in the links I posted. "

I can't override condition in the config file, so my personal use case requires direct modification of the source files.Example of a big mod: Limit Cut in Cactbot reads the number for the user and gives them a 5s warning before they get cleaved. A group would then benefit from a 5s warning before every pair of cleaves.I'm personally fine with managing versions of the files, git conflict isn't a big problem since I'll just opt to keep my version over any updates until things break. I just feel that the use case of Cactbot as a group alert is only going to get more popular and other people won't be able to cope.Regarding the huge file, I think the right fix for that is something like #860 where the user folder could support subfolders.This is what I have in mind for Option C as well.

This makes example code I wrote above does not change correctly because of space-bar differences by languages. Especially, Japanese(does not use spacebar between words) and Korean(has postpositional particle).Usually, it's like,cactbot/ui/raidboss/data/05-shb/dungeon/akadaemia_anyder.txt Line 6ine524fe8 0 \"--Reset--\" sync /00:0839:.*is no longer sealed/ window 100000 jump 0 So, this does not differ by spacebar usage.Example\"\ubc14\ud558\ubb34\ud2b8\uc758 \uc624\ub978\uc190 is no longer sealed\" should be \"\ubc14\ud558\ubb34\ud2b8\uc758 \uc624\ub978\uc190\uc758 \ubd09\uc1c4\uac00 \ud574\uc81c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\" (bold font is area name)So, we need to remove spacebar between area specified names and \"is\" on Korean translation.But,\".*is no longer sealed\" \u2192 \".*\uc758 \ubd09\uc1c4\uac00 \ud574\uc81c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\"does not need to remove spacebar.SolutionI think just not writing specific area name in front of is no longer sealed is better.Like, change 00:0839:The Right Hand of Bahamut is no longer sealed to 00:0839:.*is no longer sealedis no longer sealed is only used when resetting timeline sync.

One thing I didn't see is how long the PR build lasts; I think that's important to my overall assessment. Overall, I'm \"okay\" with this idea since it feels like the pricing tiers would never hinder us and it seems neat.However, I'm curious how much of an issue this is, and if we couldn't solve it ourselves. We build the plugin on every plugin PR thanks to MaikoTan, and you can already build to your own gh-pages so long as you push to main on your fork (see: #1883 (comment) as an example). What would be the use here other than a smoke test to confirm things still work? I would argue those should become smoke tests (which we probably are desperate for).Thinking about other things that might be neat/interesting/helpful would be a way to have raidemulator be built against a branch that a non-contributor could upload a log against (without having to clone the repository or anything) and explicitly see if their trigger issue is remedied. I don't think we're at that point yet, but this may be useful/a solution to that if we decide that's something we want in the future. I'm curious to hear what other people think. I think I'm overall warm to the idea, but I don't know if we have enough builds that come across that I would go change my ACT URL and go test for each one, if that makes sense?EDIT: I also don't mean to misrepresent why we want this, it seems like a useful tool.

But then on a different boss it says LEFT and then that is the attack zone of where the boss will attack at instead of being the safe zone.This keeps me a bit unsure for every boss when these types of alerts come up. Now i know this is just a helping hand and you aren't supposed to rely on it 100% of course, but when you do rely on it in the heat of the moment it would be great if the alerts share a common message throughout all the bosses that this supports to help keep the uncertainties away.Maybe we should should make it so instead of using the single word alerts \"Left/Right\" they can be replaced with \"Go to Left/Right\" to remove all uncertainties for the simple movement.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

This will result in approximately 3kb of memory leaked per event called. I verified this by taking snapshots of memory over an approximately hour-long period, and tracking a specific JIT'd code by ID. It persisted in memory through multiple zone changes and even a swap to a different character.The JIT'd code remained even after manually triggering GC in dev tools. It is specific to a given overlay, so reloading the overlay will clear that memory properly (tested and verified).Here's an example screenshot so you know what to look for if you're interested in following up on it. I'm not including the full stack because it contains my public IPv4 address but it eventually tracks back to native_context. "

But there are another remote B trigger sets has also a \"uwu trigger1\" overriding, while it didn't set any new property.Cactbot didn't know anything, it just runs the \"uwu trigger1\" from remote B, and then run the \"uwu custom A\" from remote A, and it gives the wrong answer.Trigger overriding orderAs described above, when applying multiple overrides, cactbot don't know which should be activated or which should be disabled, so cause the confliction and confusion.\"Why can't I add remote triggers from Author Pandragon? There are only a few triggers executed.\"I'm considering adding an AST parser to parse all js files to extract all trigger IDs and analyze them. But it's not the primary job. "

We also parse a lot of JavaScript with code and so we'd need to fix up a bunch of things to handle inconsistent quotes.I want to take a look at clang-format as an option first, because that's one thing I haven't explored before making a choice about what formatter to use.Then there's a bit of a thread from 3190; important bits:Trim21:(and indent and formatting problems are driving me crazy, why some part of this file is indented with 4 spaces? we should just add prettier with typescript......)panicstevenson:I think the issue here is that we don't have @typescript-estlint/indent, so things like types, interfaces, etc. don't have their indentation enforced. Enabling the rule and running it, there were 396 problems currently in the codebase....EDIT: Nevermind, it impacts eslint/indent, and doesn't support the same options, so that's probably a non-starter.quisquous:How do you feel about 3164?I noticed there's a comment in #3164:// The indent rule does a poor job with TypeScript type declarations, so disable., which feels like the main issue? Could we either solve that ourselves, or see what we can do with a formatter? I'm not really super opposed to a formatter + ESLint sprinkled on top, but I just haven't found anything suitable.At this point I've tried Prettier, dprint, tsfmt, and none have been able to really work. I've recently heard of Rome, but it looks like they enforce hard tabs (fine, just gross) and double quotes, which at that point we'd just use Prettier. "

Some of them are the current nuances of Dragoon for people who are blue/purple chasing for orange, so if this is ever developed, I would expect quite some time is needed to work with a proper DRG main theorycrafter.Whenever Dragon Sight is used, I'd like to track if Jump, Spineshatter, Dragonfire and the 2 respective mirage dives are used under Dragon Sight. This is one of the hallmarks of a good Dragon Sight when played optimally.Some sort of indicator that, given that you are pressing Blood for Blood, Dragon Sight, Battle Litany on cooldown, when is the next expected time they will fully overlap. (for when CDs are not fully aligned with interruptions from boss)2a. As an extension of 1 and 2, an indicator tries to guess based on whether Dragon Sight or Blood for Blood will be available in X second, you should go into Life of the Dragoon now or 30 second later so you get more buffed GK/Nastronds.A clutch for Dragoon newcomers to show them a warning when SSD, if used now, will lose them an Eye. (two mirage dive available at 2 eyes with GK on a >15s CD)Detect upcoming disconnection from the active timeline to suggest the optimal rotation for the remaining GCDs, e.g.1 GCD: ID2 GCD: ID-Dis3 GCD: TTT4 GCD: TTT45 GCD: TTT456 GCD: ID-TTT457 GCD: ID-Dis-TTT45More training wheels: Track total time X skill is off CD when boss is targetable, Jump, DS, B4B, Geirskogul, Lost eyes (Mirage Dive gained while having an unused Mirage Dive)Bonus, extra fancy stuff: After a pull ends, somehow with FFLOGs API and algorithm behind http://tethercalc.herokuapp.com/ (Xephera uses FFLOGs API to do the math too) to show the optimal Dragon Sight target per dragon sight casted.As an extension of my Dragoon ideas, Ninja can probably have something similar, with X ninki skill used, the upcoming expected ninki skill and whether it will fall under TA, whether Dream Within a Dream+Ninki is used under TA.Melee combo dropoff timer is pretty nice too.

It would be a bit handy to see visually how much time I have left until my combo drops. The reasoning for this is to avoid those rare moments when you'll return to uptime and use the 2nd or 3rd step in your combo just to realize the combo dropped right before you used it, wasting a GCD. Ideally there's no downtime ever unless something is untargetable, of course, and I am aware of that ^^@Hoshiyuu - Those are some great ideas, and are actually much more along the lines of what I'd want from this tool if DRG pr NIN was implemented into it.

I can't pull a solid example off the top of my head, but it's not always consistent. Sometimes right means the ability is firing on the right and you should stand left, sometimes it means go right because it's happening on the left.I'd just like to suggest that it's consistent and perhaps adjust the warnings to say \"Go Right\" or \"Go Left\" instead of just \"Right\" or \"Left.\" In the biggest \"figure yourself out\" moment I'll have here, I find an ambiguous statement such as \"right\" or \"left\" requires extra mental processing and ultimately having to look for sometimes less-than-obvious cues and end up getting hit anyway.This is already done on some encounters already, for example \"Go Northwest\" on the Zodiark fight.Nothing major, just asking for official consistency and more verbose directions.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

However, it just came up for me in my trial roulette and I relied on Cactbot to get me through it. Guess what, it did. And one of the best things about it? The part with the big water guy slamming his fist down on either the left or right. It was entirely and completely unambiguous: \"<= GO LEFT/WEST\" and \"GO RIGHT/EAST =>\"No thinking about it, it was clear, unambiguous. This is all I was originally asking for, and it's certainly, as I said, not a completely crazy request because it's already being done.Like, the whole point in using things like DBM or BigWigs or Cactbot is to cut down on time spent thinking about mechanics, or in my example today, help people who don't know the fight. Even knowing the intent behind the \"Right\" or \"Left\" messages being actually \"Go Left\" or \"Go Right,\" it's still something to think about. It happens in real life too, WE KNOW what left and right mean, but when there is pressure, sometimes we literally have to look at our hands or think about what is left and right. And while it may be quick, there is still an element of significantly reduced reaction time. That's the root of the problem: reaction time. Ambiguity increases reaction time. "

If you are looking at the boss from his front, its Right is now your left.So you would still move to its right (your left). You may be facing the front of the boss during that call.Others will be facing his rear.The callouts doesn't change based on which way the boss is facing relative to you personally, so if you are facing his front when the call comes out, you either need to turn your camera or simply flip the call in your head.This is a fairly common thing, especially for tanks, who tend to be facing a different side of the boss than the rest of the party.

The callouts assume that the party is in the middle of the boss room but they could just as much be Infront at times.The callouts assume you are facing the boss from behind it.It is this that gets it twisted cause in some cases from the previous mechanic it can force the party to be Infront of the boss at the time he does the slams and then the callouts needs to be reversed for all party members.

Discord bots play TTS messages synchronously, so mechanic callouts for every player and role would eventually get backed up resulting in callouts not happening until after the mechanic is over which defeats the intended purpose.Both of these are bad. If your bot is spurting irrelevant mechanics to everyone nonstop I guarantee you several people are just going to mute it for being obnoxious. You should be wanting to avoid unnecessary mechanic callouts. The less noise in voice chat the better. "

Or alternatively Options.Language should be exposed to data so you can conditionally add these based on locale.jobs: should be good to go, assuming the test page works and memory locations are not different between the English and French versions.pullcounter: resources/fights.js needs start/end regexes for different locales, and support for these in dps_phase_tracker.js and pull_counter.jsoopsyraidsy: probably partially works at the moment.regexes are all based on effect names and ability ids, so don't need to be localized.Much of the output text is just based on parsed ability names (so would be localized already) but some of it is not.This needs to have the same support that raidboss got in 6c2c560 for returning an object with different locales in it.

(Thanks!)I'll look into adding that as a default.You currently have to set the language option for each module, so user/raidboss.js needs it for raidboss and user/jobs.js also needs it for jobs, etc.I wonder if raidboss is using en triggers because you haven't set that one too.Re: test overlay.That's how they fixed GP when switching between jobs.It silently increases in the background until you switch to a gathering job which then will cap it.So, that's working properly.Do the job values work too, e.g. job: 70 MNK x | y (z) where x is your greased lightning stacks, y is your chakra stacks, and z is the ms left on greased lightning?(Sorry, again!)

For example lots of TTS currently just say the name of the attack, but only the Alert Text says what to do, not the TTS.So I'm wondering if I should only customised them for myself in my /user/raidboss.js or if I could take some freedom in the common trigger file.I did the tests you specified, none of them worked, and I made sure I reset the overlay each time, as well as making sure I properly ended up the timeline with the emote.I also made sure for the 1st one that I had nothing in the .js file for replacement, and for the second test I made sure I put back the original text in the .txt file.

This will eliminate the gap, but leaves more work for those creating timelines to identify and remove these syncs if not useful.I think I lean towardoption 2, but I don't feel very strongly about it.If no one else has an opinion, that's probably what I'll do.(cc: @JLGarber )The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

Im the Healer responsible for placing the marks. I wonder if it is intended to show that notification that \"late\" in the fight instead of right when the Dragons spawn?I like the feature, but directions are shown for only 12 sec. during a time frame where as a healer i have to deal with Tankbuster, check for fire teather out, check for Doom and check for thunder.I tried to change the duration from 12sec to a higher number just so i dont have to rush it and kinda take my time for when im not \"busy\" with mechanics. when i tried to change it to a higher number, i kinda broke it. lol. i didnt had any notification of the directions anymore, so i just put back my backup^^My question is, is there a way to show the direction for A-B-C when the dragons actually spawn? \"Dragon Favour\" is the skill that spawns them. OR simply extend the notification duration from 12sec to .. i dont know, even until the dives actually happen. so i dont have to rush them or trying to memorize until im not busy on my role.if Dragon Favour does not work as a trigger to show that information, maybe a work around would work. something like, well Dragon Favour cast finishes ~8 sec after Nael spawn. maybe say 10sec after Nael spwn = show location for dragon dive markersthanks for any tippsThe text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

It would be helpful to have the arrow stop showing after a certain distance away from the hunt, maybe the same distance it takes to detect it or a fixed configurable distance or expire after a certain amount of time.I think the option that shows you the hunt puller is swell, but it I wish it stored even if just temporarilythe name of the puller, this would mostly be useful to know if early pullers are around using player search.To then use this information to relay the hunt to linkshells hopefully before the pull happens. This can take form of anything, an echo message, a temporary log file, a console message, just something you can check who pulled when the hunt is done.A way to input in the name of players/mobs for the radar without having to deal with javascript (this is probably for later when the GUI comes in?), would mostly be useful for things like quickly tracking monster needed for hunt spawns (For example the kills needed for Okina), find an NPC or spook a friend.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

It might not even be the case that regexes are the biggest issue.It's possible that time spent in regexes is small compared to time spent in Chrome internals and so the best performance win is to fix up CSS to reduce rendering time.Or maybe OverlayPlugin's time spent generating DPS information is much huger than any time spent in raidboss and so that would be a much better thing to fix.It's not clear to me at all where time is being spent and what proportion of time is being spent in various parts of the system.Sorry to be negative here, but what I'm trying to get is that I would like to avoid optimizations where we assume we know what the problem is and add performance fixes without measuring and end up adding complexity with no benefit.

Something like:masterObject: {actionsToTranslate: {Action1: 'ID1',Action2: 'ID2',// ETC},statusesToTranslate: {Status1: 'ID1',Status2: 'ID2',// ETC},// ETC}From here we could just update a file in one place, and then run a script to pull in translations and update the relevant language files.A more expansive solution that also doesn't make structural changes would be a script to scan trigger files for k[whatever] elements, grabbing those translations from the appropriate resource sites, and automagically dropping those into the relevant translation objects in each [language].js file.I'm not familiar enough with the internals of the translation engine to speculate about how we might change that if we're going to do something structural, unfortunately.

Or maybe they could get grouped in another file?This is all a bit wishy washy, but I think what I'm getting at is that I like the way that raidboss just explicitly handles translations and passes around response objects with multiple translations in them to select from.I wonder if it'd be better to just drop the lang.js and friends files entirely and move towards data structures and functions that require explicitly passing in the current language.This would at least make everything more consistent.

My suggestion is only a continuation of the workaround I had to do to achieve a similar result; it's only worth doing if it takes under 30 minutes.EDIT: jesus it's long, I should email this or something.The following discussion is not really relevant since it's just my impression from learning to use cactbot. I'm happy with the changes to be made this weekend, tentatively. Anyway, some feedback!Long-term, I agree that Options.DisabledTriggers and Options.PerTriggerOptions are probably fine for most use cases (most people are happy with defaults), but I still think it's slightly too unfriendly towards user customization. Here's what I mean:Imagine a user who wants to edit all the alert texts for built-in triggers. Her reasons may vary, but these are two I cooked up on the fly for discussions:Someone might prefer to be told specifically what to do (Shield the tank), whileSomeone else might prefer to be informed of the event so they can come up with the correct response (e.g. no need to shield the tank if he's already used Holmgang)The triggers shipped with Cactbot cannot satisfy all use cases, so there is some argument to be made for small but overarching modifications like changing the text.So, let's say that this user's desire is legitimate. How does she go about achieving it? She can't modify the triggers directly in the ~/ui/raidboss/triggers/tsukuyomi-ex.js file, since those are meant to be overwritten with future updates. She would have to get the trigger ids from that file and modify each entry like I did in the ~/user/raidboss.js config file.In terms of keystrokes, both options don't differ by much, but in terms of usability, it's a huge gap. An average user can find the text and replace it with what they want; an average user can't read the appropriate README to understand that they need to reference each trigger by unique keys in a specific Javascript object in a specific file.It's not a big deal but it discourages you from making small \"quality of life\" changes.I love the JSON user config schema, but I think that use case and ours are significantly different. Take VSCode, for example, the user config in that context is content-agnostic: it doesn't matter if I'm editing a javascript file or a python file, or if I'm doing webdev or game design, I want my font to be size 12. These settings are global, so they should be grouped together in one place.User config in Cactbot is not content-agnostic; changing the text for tank buster in Tsukuyomi doesn't do anything for the tank busters in o8s. Since the effect of the settings are less than globals, I think it makes some sense to have them localized into their own scope, so that if I want to change something about the tank buster in o8s (like an alert for which cooldown to use), I don't have to browse through 20 other fights.What I have in mind instead is to duplicate the triggers file into ~/user/raidboss/tsukuyomi-ex.js, comment out all the values, and allow the user to toggle it on as they find/modify it. Since ~/user/raidboss.js already sources ~/ui/raidboss/data/triggers/tsukuyomi-ex.js, we only need to make ~/ui/.../tsukuyomi-ex.js source ~/user/raidboss/tsukuyomi-ex.js where the user config for that fight sits.Back to reality, your config file is less than 100 LOCs, but it basically only modifies one encounter. At any given time, a user may expect to go into 4~6 different encounters. If you run with pug groups and have to make on the fly modifications in between pulls, it'll be a bad time. "

I modify my UCoB timeline to match my groups use of waymarks when calling divebombs, as one timeline example. I also find it very frustrating to have to disable sound alerts every update via a text file, since its always easiest to overwrite the directory as a \"clean install\" every new update imo. CSS is also something I do modify, but that's really secondary to this whole issue.Even something so simple as the ability to quickly navigate to where these files live would help. Its very cumbersome navigating through all the data by hand, and for a user who may not understand the directory structure its confusing to know where the files should live. "

I've changed language on some timelines like O8S as well: \"bait then stay\" for forsaken 2 would just constantly confuse me; personally I like to see/hear mechanic names (Future/Past) clearly stated flat out to know what to execute. ESPECIALLY in any prog. I know what to do, I dont like to hear what action to perform - it was difficult for me to understand Nael's timeline and actions in UCoB with cactbot because \"in/out\" didn't make sense to me (it does now, but would still probably prefer Chariot/Dynamo spoken and overlayed).Having several version of timelines for these specific cases isn't necessary - my brain simply works differently than some players.

module only provide customization for some basic function and CSS now, which cannot meet the need of many users\uff1ae.g. #3328 ask to add icon for timers, and display option of pull bar, HP/MP bars.In #3682, I have modified stucture of every job to class implementation which initialize all HTML element references in constructor, inherit and modify onXxx function of parent class, and even subscribe more event based on Event Emitter to complete job UI.Existing issuesWhether previous method or method in my PR do not allow user modifying function or referanced HTML element in clsss to customize UI layout, timers and resource bar/box in Bars.#3682 provide a method to customize bars in Bars by inherit ShouldShow attribute in every job component as follow:type ShouldShow = {buffList?: boolean;pullBar?: boolean;hpBar?: boolean;mpBar?: boolean;cpBar?: boolean;gpBar?: boolean;mpTicker?: boolean;};In my desire, Bars._setupJobContainers(a function to be called when job changed to create bars below) will read ShouldShow attribute in job component to control element display. However, other elements in job component are initialised in constructor now, and this function cannot read ShouldShow attribute before job component instantiation.Possible solutionsSolutionsFirst, add setup function in job component, move element initialization step to this function which in constructor previously. This function can be called by ComponentManager after job component initialization complete to ensure element in component constructed before subscribed. By this, ComponentManager can call Bars._setupJobContainers before bars and boxes in job component initialized like hp-bar mp-bar .Such job component will be like this:class BLMComponent extends BaseComponent {shouldShows: { hpBar: true };thunderBox?: TimerBox;setup() {this.thunderBox = this.bars.addProcBox({});}reset() {this.thunderBox?.threshold = 0;}}As shown, for removel of HTML element instantiation step in constructor, these boxes and bars should be rewritten to optional element to pass the type verification of TypeScript. Furthermore, many optional chaining property accessing notations should be added to other function, which makes code ugly and hard to read. However, this may not be the biggest problems for user can only override JavaScript file. I fear this may cause puzzling issues like Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined in customization.customization methodAdd a new function in Options like Options.OverrideComponent with job name as the first parameter and previous job component as the second like this:// ui/jobs/jobs_options.tsexport type JobsOptions = {// ...OverrideComponent: (job: Job, override: (Component: typeof BaseComponent) => BaseComponent) => typeof BaseComponent;// ...}Then user can customize specific job component by this function and return class of modified component\uff1aOptions.OverrideComponent('BLM', (BLMComponent) => {return class OverrideBlmComponent extends BLMComponent {shouldShow = { hpBar: false } // I don't need HP Barsetup() {// can call super.setup() to initialize originally defined elementsuper.setup();// or do not call super, initialize your own element instead.}onYouGainEffect(id, matches) {// if you call super.setup() to use original element in parent class in setup, // then you should use super.onYouGainEffect(id, matches) to execute originally defined method,// or originally defined boxes and bars will break down.super.onYouGainEffect(id, matches);// Of course you can throw away super and execute your own method.// ...}}});Yon can also copy and modify class in ui/jobs/component/blm.ts, but remenber user/ Folder only support JavaScript, so you should delete TypeScript grammar in original file.NoteAny suggestion is welcomed, both developer's and user's. I understand either way cannot avoid user coding JavaScript, but we can provide easier API to free user from complex and strange JS rule. "

                "content": "As shown, for removel of HTML element instantiation step in constructor, these boxes and bars should be rewritten to optional element to pass the type verification of TypeScript.What about always creating the elements but only optionally attaching them? You could pass a shouldShow: boolean to functions like addProcBox and inside of that function skip calling addChild if it shouldn't show.That way you always have an element, but it may not always be attached to the DOM and visible.Add a new function in Options like Options.OverrideComponentThis part I am less sure about.I don't think this would solve #3328, both because that user does not know how to use JavaScript but also because I think it would likely be tough to implement your own proc boxes with icons (which doesn't exist) from inside of a user javascript file.The worry for me is that the more you expose to JavaScript, the more you are allowing users to depend on the internal implementation.This is just my opinion (and maybe others disagree), that if a user knows enough to implement their own jobs component, then they also know enough to make a cactbot fork and implement what they need (in typescript).I don't think that there exists users who both know enough to make these changes and also are holding off because there isn't user file support, if that makes sense.Any suggestion is welcomedI think the real question to be answered first is, what do people want out of jobs? Here are some things I've heard:hide proc boxes (or some of the proc boxes?)hide pull bar / only have pull barmove proc boxes closer to hp bars (yes you can do this with CSS, but maybe it's been asked enough we should have an option, or we should just move them close and people who wanted it the other way can use CSS)only show buffs (which I added an option for)So, I think there could be room for adding more config options for hiding/showing various bits of UI that people want, and I think that would address the biggest complaints.However, I think it might be better if users want to add arbitrary UI to use something like ZeffUI instead, which is meant to be highly configurable (without JavaScript) in a way that I don't think cactbot jobs is really set up to do.So really the question is, what is cactbot jobs trying to be? I think for me, that it's trying to be something like raidboss: opinionated pre-sets that come with a lot already set up but isn't necessarily meant to be extremely configurable down to the smallest degree without writing code.Maybe you feel like cactbot jobs should be something different and I have the wrong idea of what it should do?

The reason why I create this issue is I found this bug but I'm not familiar with cactbot, and affected zones are Snowcloak, The Keeper of the Lake, Sohm Al, The Aery, The Vault, Thornmarch (Hard) and The Steps of Fait, and I am not able to test if its timeline and trigger still valid in 6.2 (I am a CN player and don't have an international purchase), but I can do something in this case.I would make a PR fixing that, and to make sure the name is not ambiguous with current version, I would add (6.1) as prefix in the content name (Since it need to divide into two files for different version).

It does appear to be relative to maximum HP, and updates automatically as your max HP changes.One thing I did notice was that, despite the ingame UI only showing \"...\" for absorbs larger than your HP bar, the number does accurately reflect absorbs which are only slightly larger than 100%, however it caps out at 200%.

I installed Cactbot using act and it is in my Plugin Listing tab and active so thats no issue. My problem is in the Overlayplugin.dll tab when I press New and go to the dropdown menu I dont see any Cactbot options. I even tried to copy/paste the cactbotoverlay.dll into the addons folder in the Overlay folderlike I saw online and then change the plugin in the Plugin Listings tab just to see and still not 1 Cactbot option.Can anyone help me and tell me where I went wrong if I went wrong?Thanks :)The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

                "content": "02C3 is indeed the correct opcode for detecting this (the 0014 is in every package at that position, I believe, but I may be wrong).If you cross-reference the sapphire source code at1https://github.com/SapphireServer/Sapphire/blob/399d9b0dcd6d87aa624bd53c58415efa27bb1b1c/src/common/Network/PacketDef/Ipcs.h#L183It would imply that it's used more generally. I don't know if ACT itself provides access to this kind of opcode outside of reading the debug logs, though. If so, that'd be super helpful -- otherwise this changes with each patch :( Anyway.The structure for this opcode is documented (or, more correctly, guessed) here:https://github.com/SapphireServer/Sapphire/blob/399d9b0dcd6d87aa624bd53c58415efa27bb1b1c/src/common/Network/PacketDef/Zone/ServerZoneDef.h#L1393And using the names of fields from above, here's what I know holds true for normal fishing:The eventId for any fish event is 0x00150001.scene = 1: you just cast your line, i.e. started fishingscene = 2, param5 == 0: caught fishscene = 2, param5 != 0: fish got awayscene = 3: leaving fishing holescene = 5, param5 == 0x124: weak bite, one !scene = 5, param5 == 0x125: medium bite, two !!scene = 5, param5 == 0x126: strong/legendary bite, three !!!I believe some field is set to indicate a collectable (and holds the rating), but it's been a month or two since I looked at it in any capacity. I also haven't tried ocean fishing yet since I've been away from the game and only recently returned, but I would assume stuff to be similar.This information was also collected before the headmarkers were implemented (and I have some opcodes going back to 4.5), so I'm not actually sure if the headmarkers have different network packets.You can generally find the opcode rather easily if you turn on debug logs, and search for |00150001| after casting your line once.But that brings a more important question: Would a contribution that relies on this kind of hack (i.e. reading game log lines manually, be okay? I would think it should be implemented in a way that supplements the current code, and should fall back to the current way of detecting bites. It is work to be done for every new minor patch that is released; and I know you're often busy with the more non-fishing side of things. I know there's a similar thing implemented in the FateWatcher, and that brings with it issues in different game versions & locales.1: The historical opcodes for patches where I did fish and which I did use for detecting fish events are as follows: 4.5 - 01AB; 5.0 - 01B5; 5.1 - 0096; 5.18 - 0279; 5.2 - 01F3.

If the rules of timing the bites suddenly changed for a week after every patch, it would introduce a lot of noise in the timer database and would practically render this entire improvement useless.But yeah, I agree with what you said, and it's how I thought this could work too.

Given that the next major patch is coming up in a month or so, I'll probably prioritize this in preparation.Primarily, I'm looking to update translate_fight to add a separate translation path that would look something like this:Parse the timeline file for ability IDs and boss names.Issue requests to XIVAPI to pull down the appropriate translations.Consolidate the data and merge it into the existing JSON output stream. (Or maybe take a trigger file as optional input and automagically append the JSON output in the right place? I'm not as comfortable with that sort of file manipulation yet, but that might be ideal.)The clear advantage to this over FFLogs translation is that this would just pull down the needed abilities based on the timeline, with no need to cull superfluous elements. The downside is that XIVAPI (so far as I'm aware) doesn't contain CN localizations, so we would have to pull those in from elsewhere.I think the recent changes to regex handling will probably negate the need for the trigger updates portion of check_translation going forward.I'm not sure what other features would be necessary or useful while doing these updates, so please let me know what else I should consider while planning this.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

Obviously older timelines are a little messier, but I think it's safe to assume any future timelines will include syncs for every relevant ability. Given this, what other assumptions can we make about the sync regex? I'm sort of thinking we should start with this list:00, usually as 00:0839:[ZONE] will be sealed off.03, as 03:........:Added new combatant [NAME]15/16, as :[NAME]:[HEX ID]:.That should cover 95% of cases without trouble. There's obviously going to be some special handling for 15/16 lines that include multiple matches, as in /:Titan:(40FF|4100):/. (I'm not completely sure on what that handling should be, since sometimes it's multiple skills that could happen, and sometimes it's a single skill name with multiple different IDs.) But apart from that, for each line, we can just check whether [ELEMENT] is already present in the extracted_data list, and if not, append to that list, converting hex to decimal before doing so.That's what I've been thinking of so far, but I'd be happy for there to be a simpler setup.

(There aren't any current timelines that use the source for buffs, and I can't imagine a situation where it would be necessary.)Aside from that, it's nearly done. Cafemaker doesn't seem to have the same search endpoint format that XIVAPI does, so for now this doesn't have Chinese support and just uses XIVAPI, but it runs twice as fast as FFLogs translation.

Currently it looks like all timeline files follow the second convention.Maybe instead of trying to do it all in a single line, I'll just use the regex as-is and do a second step to extract the actual effect, something like buff_match[2].split(' from')[0]? Probably simpler than trying to change things around in the tools file.(I can't put my hands on any examples right now, but I'm relatively sure I've seen log lines in that second format before.

For test_timeline there's a whole bunch of stuff that should be addressed, but for auto-generation... I just can't see expending much effort to \"properly fix\" something that's only going to come up again once more.I don't know. I'm not trying to sound super dismissive here! I think as far as here-and-now solutions, we're probably best off doing your second suggestion, mapping each line number in the network log to type as expected from FFlogs. Even though in practice we don't use that feature much, it's worth ensuring it functions and is readable. "

Most of us here know that we can check the recent releases/commit history to see what may have been recently added, but for users unaware that Github exists, that might not be intuitive. Additionally, it is almost certainly not intuitive for users to check the Raidboss manifest.txtIt Would Be Nice to have a single human-readable list that can be linked in response to this frequent question. I'm envisioning Yet Another Release Script that would build this out in much the same way as, say, hunts.js.The easiest would be to scan through manifest.txt and check for whether both a timeline and a trigger file exist. Obviously this wouldn't be a perfect heuristic, but for old content it should work well enough. (This would maybe require that we don't do placeholder timelines though when new content releases? Could be an issue.) A slightly more difficult implementation might parse whether any given trigger file contains triggers or not.Maybe in addition we could combine this with parsing whether or not a trigger file has a given language translated or not, since that's another common question?The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

Over time, there's been over 150+ committers to cactbot (thank you all) and it's long been a group effort and not just my own.

Or should they look more like trigger files so folks can more easily copy and paste from cactbot triggers? Or is it confusing to have different types of files, and better to keep it consistent?What files to load in the subdirectory: I think just any .js file underneath, ignoring .git subfolders?

This isn't necessarily a problem, since I would assume part of the process of moving to Yarn would be that conversion step, but it is something to be aware of.It's also important that we consider the novice contributor. When I started contributing here, I knew next to nothing about package managers and build tools. Those were things for Experienced And Serious Software Engineers, while I just wanted to write a few lines of Javascript. Installing NPM is already a bit of a barrier for newer contributors, and we really want to do our best to ensure that we do not make things more difficult for them, if possible.Laying that aside, I think moving to Yarn is worth serious consideration just on the basis of improved speed and reduced disk churn. With the next expansion coming up, and all the new content that we will have to add, cutting off 10-15% of the time spent waiting for our tools to work would really add up.How much effort would it take to set up a \"prototype\" Yarn environment or sandbox that we could try? I am happy to provide feedback on something like that, but I would have very little to contribute as far as putting it together. "

It looks similar to #3415 but I'm not sure that they are KR specific problems. I saw UWU Titan Gaols and so UWU Titan Bomb Failure triggers do not work. Also, many community members said that in UCoB, UCU Nael Fireball 2 trigger outputs only fireOutBeInIt no matter what ice debuff count is. Another debuff triggers, like UCU Nael Thunderstruck and doom counts also seem not to work. I remeber that they had no problems on Feb 15th when I was in UCoB, so I guess it has occured after v0.24.20. May you examine whether they are global cactbot issue or because of parser version as before, or something else?Additional informationhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1sm-BEdCRNB-5tR7Miukq_ZON6int_1O0/view?usp=sharingThe UCoB log is provided by my friend.+Minor problem: Encounters in my previous UCoB log(on Feb 15th) and UCoB log in the link above cannot be loaded in raidemulator.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

I mean I thought parser totally does not work with different language setting.If this is possible, there can be added \"Game client language\" option on cactbot configuration, and overrides Parser Language, which are not overrided by Display language, with Game client language.

Even though you select English in Parser setting.\"Display language\" is translated to Korean as \"Main language\". \"\uc8fc \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5b8\uc5b4(\u4e3b \u4f7f\u7528 \u8a00\u8a9e)\" in Korean hanja.I see. ( Hanja helps me a lot haha ) So even I set the default value in \"Alert Language\" and \"Timeline Language\", only if I set \"Display Language\" as Japanese, those two would be Japanese too.It seems that the Japanese option string has not updated after your change. I may take time to deal with them later.There's no usage with PC Locale except configurations. I don't think cactbot cannot get language setting of FFXIV_ACT_Plugin, but this change was originally made to show configuration page with PC's language.Yeah, then, by the way, I think I'm a little weirdo on these things (\u00b4\u3002\uff3f\u3002\uff40) .For some reason so I have to use en-US as my PC Locale, but I am more comfortable with Japanese or Chinese. So if you can provide an option like \"UI Language\", or just use \"Display Language\" as configurations displaying ( just like the code I wrote above? ), I'll be appreciated about it.Does that work? I thought parser language and game client language should be same. I mean I thought parser totally does not work with different language setting.No, it doesn't work. When I set the different language between game client and parser, cactbot would not work. But I want it to work.However, By your information, It seems like I can only set the same language settings in-game and parser. Every time I change my language setting in-game, I should change it in parser too?If this is possible, there can be added \"Game client language\" option on cactbot configuration, and overrides Parser Language, which are not overrided by Display language, with Game client language.Well, as described above. It is not bad if there is a \"Game client language\" option, but that would make other users confused, like: \"Why are there so many options about languages?\".Plus, by adding this option, most regex pipeline code mechanics of raidboss, oopsyraidsy and jobs should be re-wrote a lot.I don't think there are few people like me using different language in game client against parser, and even change it eventually. So this option might not a good idea. "

This can replace the PC's locale, but I believe I had some problem with it.I am busy these days and I think I cannot contribute here before university summer vacation.I mean I know cactbot don't work with different language setting between parser and client, but I thought parsing is broken for everything with different language setting.

But I want it to work.Can you help me try to understand why?Sorry, my misunderstanding! I thought that Lee was talking about cactbot would work or not!Well, parser would work as usual even with different language settings against game client.For example, in my case, I set game language as en, but parser language is ja.Parser would translate most of localized string in-game into Japanese, like skill name, buff name, zone name and so on.However, type 00 GameLog would remain in English, since it is directly extract from game.So some plugin like cactbot, try to match LogLine with regex written in Japanese would not work. i.e, regex like Countdown, CancelCountdown,ZoneSeal and so on.I do not understand the difference you are trying to make between \"parser language\" and \"game client language\".The \"parser language\" value comes from the Plugins -> FFXIV Settings -> Options -> Game Language field.These to me are the same thing.\"parser language\" and \"game client language\" are both \"what language do I need to write regular expressions against to match logs from the game\".\"display language\" is \"what does the user of cactbot want their UI to appear as\".In fact, I just often forgot to change my parser language as well after I change my game language.I know literally it should be the same between game language and parser.But ACT works normally even with different language settings.Maybe this is just my own problem, since I can set it the same, so never mind.I think in your use case, you want to set FFXIV's game language to English (because you're playing in English) but cactbot's display language to Japanese.This sort of use case was precisely the goal of having a separate display language option.Yes, yes.At the first time, I was confused with those language because the option text in Japanese have not updated after Lee's commit. So I ask what are these languages use for.But now it is clear to me since Lee's explanation was easy to understand. "

Currently the on-screen callout text for this is \"Second Towers\" while the players that did not get hit receive \"First Towers.\"The most common strategy for this mechanic is to assign towers to pairs of players, most commonly role pairs, then assigning towers to each, such as THMR. If both melee players are hit, for instance, one of them would need to flex and take the ranged tower. Flexers are typically assigned at the start of the encounter.It would be helpful if the trigger could identify and callout the other Support/DPS player that has the matching debuff/no-debuff, much like the Snake Debuff callouts in P8Sp1. Would it be feasible for this to be included?Thank youThe text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

One example is \"[0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1]: [\"N\",\"S\",\"N\"].The first two dragons are NE and E, so you put mark 1 north.The second dragon is SW so you put mark 2 south.The final two dragons are W and NW.You have two options, you can put mark 3 SW (in front of dragon 2) or N.SW is less safe, because there's less time between mark placement and dive.There's more time to wait for the first dive and place it north, imo.I took a look through the network log that was sent and didn't see anything that looked wrong to me.I think if you have a pull where something appears different than the above list, or worse that somebody is told to go a direction that doesn't correspond to what the directions are, please let me know.It would be helpful to have a log with a specific pull time that did something wrong.This may be a similar question to #1521, where you disagree with what's considered safe or not here.

Not that the recent swaths of refactoring are infallible, but I don't see anything substantial that changed in the cactbot code with respect to those triggers; however, the code for those triggers hinges upon some assumptions about the flow of the fight. What's interesting here is I feel like I wrote this code to be fairly generic; we know the first sweep based off abilityId and we simply increment from there. My fear here would be that each headMarker has been randomized individually instead of having a randomized offset. The flip side is maybe headMarkers were silently patched in one of the downstream dependencies to take account of the offset? That feels unlikely though, and I would expect this code to still work in the event that all the headMarkers were shifted by the same number.Do you have a network log you would be able to share? I also am worried about TEA if the offset is no longer one value per instance. "

DRS trigger 'DelubrumSav Avowed Hot And Cold Unwavering Apparations' (Sword Avatar phase of Trinity Avowed) cannot read data and only shows unknown(???). I knew that the DRS js file in v0.23.4 is still not fully translated, so I guessed that it may be boss name translation missing problem. However, though the complete KR translation for DRS is included in v0.23.5 release and the other triggers work well as translated, the trigger still shows only ???. I saw the trigger has had some issues and fixed before, so I checked my ACT's network parsing setting and questioned to Korean FFXIV communities, but no one said that it works in FFXIV Korea.The other issue comes up after I updated cactbot to v0.23.5 release. At first, I noticed that E12S trigger 'E12S Promise Cast Release' doesn't work(even not showing unknown sign). I checked raidboss emulator with my log and Cast Realease doesn't exist.'E12S Promise Stock' works. Only cast and release are in problem.After few hours later when I joined DRS party, I could find some more triggers which do not work just like E12S Promise Cast Release. Here are they:DelubrumSav Seeker Dead IronDelubrumSav Seeker Iron SplitterDelubrumSav Guard Fiery PortentDelubrumSav Guard Icy PortentDelubrumSav Avowed Gleaming ArrowThe others in DRS(from first to Avowed) work well, if I remember correctly.Also, I checked it with some of my friends, and they all said that E12S Promise Cast Release in v0.23.5 is not working with their ACT.All situation above occur with FFXIV Korea client. If possible, I will test with Global FFXIV client soon. I can't find suitable party now.

I worry a little bit that often a lot of the logic on whether or not a trigger gets shown is not in the condition function itself (or the condition function is only half of it), so it seems to me like simpler is better here, especially if there's not a full solution.The other thing I've been thinking about recently to make the config ui better is after #2674 lands to have the config ui have a link to the file on github where it comes from, so you can easily go look at the full source if you wanted to.

I've set the min cooldown to 9999; result is it always shows the cooldown for my raidbuff.Hopefully the gif would explain it, in the gif. I've popped divination, my friends popped battle voice; which wears off, it doesn't however show how many seconds left before battle voice comes off CD like divination does.Which it used to do before Endwalker.Sorry for the low quality gif. Here's an example of, cactbot jobs showing how long until party members raidbuffs are off CD, before endwalker..Here's how it is currently. It shows how long my Div has until it gets off CD, but it doesn't show Battle Litany's timer. "

I tried using the existing combo tracker for this, something like:if (beast == 100 || beast == 90 && this.combo.current == gLang.kAbility.Maim) {let audio = new Audio('../../resources/sounds/WeakAuras/Shotgun.ogg');audio.volume = 1.0;audio.play();}but this doesn't work as expected. The reason is that by the time this event fires, the combo tracker hasn't been updated yet. Really, the logic I need is that it should warn me if Maim was the ability that got me to 90 beast gauge, since that means there's a very real possibility I might use Storm's Path next. But for that to work, there needs to be a correct ordering between these events so that the plugin \"sees\" that Maim was used before it updates the beast gauge.Alternatively, I could put that logic somewhere else, i.e. have it check for (near-)capped beast gauge when the event fires for the actual ability being used that generated beast gauge.Thoughts?The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

If it is, party will go east, since west is being cauterized. If the X-position is >= 100, then party will go west since either middle or east is being cauterized.At the same time, 9 fireballs are being spawned in the following locations (I believe the npcBaseID are all 13238):Middle: (x,94), (x, 100), (106,106)Northeast/Northwest: (x,81), (x,87), (x,93)Southeast/Southwest: (x, 107), (x, 113), (x,119)The fireballs will spawn in sets of 3 in the order of either Middle, Northwest/Northeast, then Southeast/Southwest or Middle, Southeast/Southwest, then Northwest/Northeast. The safe spot is based on where the last set of fireballs spawn and can be determined after the 2nd set appears (i.e. will always be either North or South).Hoping for some help to create a trigger that can call an intercardinal quadrant by combining both sets of conditions.

I additionally attempted to initiate the test with a /bow emote, which similarly failed. The D.Va voice lines that should play never soundThe log in the OverlayPlugin for both the Eureka and Raidboss report the same things, I have included a screenshot below.Other things of note:When checking \"Lock Overlay\" for both the Eureka and Raidboss plugins, the boxes disappear. Previously, while the Eureka plugin was functioning, it needed to have \"Enable Clickthru\" checked and \"Lock Overlay\" unchecked, or it would not show at all, and in this mode would always show the blue test border - From re-reading the documentation it appears this is not intentional,The \"Test Bar 1\" through \"Test Bar 6\" portrayed in the documentation for the Raidboss plugin never appear. It seems this is supposed to show when widening the box significantly, however after widening it to nearly full-screen, no hint of it was found.Other installed plugins are: Ravahn's ACT plugin, Hibiyasleep's revamped version of RainbowMage's OverlayPlugin, Annoyetta's 'Hojoring' version of the SpecialSpellTimer plugin, and the FFXIV MemoryReader plugin the SpecialSpellTimer plugin recommends.All three appear to function normally, leading me to believe the issue to be with the Cactbot plugin(s).All testing was done on a fresh installation of ACT, with only the aforementioned plugins installed.I apologise for posting this in such a confusing manner, I just noted down every detail I could think of because I don't know exactly what you need to know.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

Pillory in Holminster Switch) are still using an ad-hoc version.However, the point is more around the \"well, if users don't like it, they can disable it\" conclusion.The issue, for me, is that I play multiple roles.I don't care about tankbusters as a DPS, but I very much do care about them when I'm tanking or healing.I'd like to propose either:A global \"don't show tank alerts as DPS\" option (and maybe also one for healer and tank, but eh).This would apply to tankbusters for sure, and maybe also tank cleaves and other tank-centered effects that DPS generally don't have to muck with.OR:A new enhancement to the config in the UI that lets the user specify that the alerts should only fire for X roles.This would be be a series of checkboxes (probably a horizontal row, but UI design isn't my forte) listing the 5 roles in FFXIV (tank, healer, melee, ranged, caster).Default checked state could be all on, or defined by the trigger, or only tanks and healers, whatever seems to make the most sense.But that would let users directly control whether each trigger showed for any given role, without having to manually go in and change them every time they decide to swap to tanking or healing for a change.Edit: also, the intent with this one is that it'd apply globally to all alerts, providing the customization regardless of the alert type (ex. if DPS or tanks don't care about general raid AoE hits that are there mostly just to give healers something to do).Personally, I prefer the second option, as it affords the greater amount of control and flexibility (ie. can set a tankbuster on one fight to show but not on another, depending on relevance to your role), but I'm not sure on the relative effort between the two, or which y'all feel would make more sense from a UX perspective.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: \ud83d\udc4d1 gamescom15 reacted with thumbs up emoji \ud83d\udc4d1 reaction"

It's also unfortunate that you still feel your particular opinion on which triggers people should care about is the only one that matters.Realistically, it's far easier to implement a single solution that universally affects all triggers than it is to individually overwrite each trigger, both now and then again for each new set of content added going forward.The plugin already has the ability to customize the alert set for any given trigger.I fail to see how it would take extensive refactoring or run the risk of duplicate alert to simply add an additional setting, applied in the same area, which compares the user's current role against the set of roles they've set that trigger to display for, and if not set, suppress the alert entirely (as if they'd selected Disabled in the customization dropdown).You're already having to do logic in that area related to the user's selection in the dropdown.In any case, your underestimate of the scope of the overrides is substantial.Perhaps I'm simply engaging with more content still than you do (I've only been playing this game for a few months, after all).Just in Shadowbringers, there's 13 dungeons, each of which contain 3 bosses, nearly all of which contain at least one tankbuster that I don't care to have an alert for (I nearly always use my Addle/group DR cooldowns on group damage rather than tankbusters).There's also 7 trials, and their extreme versions, 3 alliance raids (4-5 bosses each), and 12 levels of Eden.Overall, if I want to factor out the tankbuster in just Shadowbringers content (and that's ignoring all of the incidences of it that I run into during my plethora of roulettes that hit prior expansion content), that's at a minimum some 70 alert overrides.And there's certain to be a similar number in Endwalker, over the course of the content drops.And for each of those overrides, it isolates me from any bugfixes, improvements, or other changes you make to those triggers going forward, unless I critically scan every commit for changes to those specific triggers and update mine for the same.That's especially relevant if I apply such override early in the content cycle (such as right when then Endwalker plugin updates are pushed out), as those are almost certain to have some tweaks and bugfixes applied.On the flip side, adding in this feature would apply to every trigger currently in the game and every trigger added in the future, and wouldn't even be a specific change in each trigger definition.The concept I had would be for the changes to be applied at the same level as the settings are currently evaluated for the dropdown that selects the alert type (including, potentially, Disabled).Those settings would now include a mapping of which roles the users selected to show the alert (and again, the default for that could easily simply be all of them selected), and if the user's current role is not selected, the trigger simply acts as if Disabled had been set in the dropdown (with the exception that abilities targeted on the user will always display regardless of role).In fact, such a system could easily replace the existing ad-hoc role conditions you have applied, simply by allowing triggers to specify an alternative set of default roles selected (for example, cleaved tankbusters, which you don't want displayed to DPS to avoid people inadvertently stacking for them, could be set by default as just healers and tanks, but could be turned on by DPS such as a raid leader that wants to know when they are happening).Ultimately, it's your plugin.If you don't want to go that direction, well, that's simply unfortunate.But I think you're underestimating the benefit, and overestimating the changes required (and underestimating the work required for the \"workaround\" options).This is adding user customizability, the ability of the users rather than the plugin authors to determine which abilities they should care about and which they don't, which is almost never a bad thing to add.

                "content": "As with nearly everything, it's a tradeoff.It's a fair point.And mine apologies if I made it sound like this is merely stubbornness on your part.As you say, I think this ultimately comes down to a judgment on how many users are likely to engage with the feature, versus how many are not.The current options for customizing notifications are fairly basic, being confined to a handful of options as far as alert type, and then an option to set the actual text displayed.All other customization requires at least some knowledge of and comfort with editing code files.While the actual implementation of those custom triggers is likely something you (and I) find to be quite easy, from a mechanical perspective, I know many who would be overwhelmed by the mere prospect of trying to put together a custom trigger, regardless of how many help comments and examples were given, and regardless of how much of it was, tbh, essentially copy-paste with some tweaking.I think software engineers like you and I sometimes forget how daunting looking at code can be for those not familiar with coding as a concept.That's why \"maintain this feature across all triggers\" has a cost.But that was really my point.Handling this on a trigger-by-trigger basis is a huge amount of work, both now and for every single feature going forward.If, on the other hand, this were implemented in a single common function that all of the triggers leverage (or even a handful of them), like the same config set you store the existing options for displaying text, sound, and/or TTS, that the solution would be a set-it-and-forget-it without needed maintenance except where code that affects it actually changes.The default for triggers without a configured set of options could be all-roles-selected, and then maybe the triggers could override it if the trigger needs to be specific (but you'd only need to define it for triggers that are specific, and only if you want to go that direction; the existing role conditions are probably fine if you don't).Now, unfortunately, I don't know Typescript (or Javascript, for that matter, my primary language is Go), and looking over the code for this plugin is in fact the first time I've encountered Typescript code, else I would have simply PR'd the changes by now.I have a vague idea of where the code for it might live and how it might work, but my knowledge of TS simply isn't up to the task ('yet', potentially).The changes and the workaround are both roughly the same set of work.Only if you presume the only possible solution on the plugin side is to edit every single trigger.And that's not what I'm proposing.I'm proposing a new option created (I'd assume this would be in a single place, as I assume each trigger simply uses a template to generate its options section in the UI), and then the selection for those would be leveraged in a single or possible a handful of places, depending on how the triggers are actually handled (tbh, it's a bit difficult following the program flow, not knowing the particulars of TS syntax), where in some common function each of the triggers ultimately passes through before being displayed, it would check that optionset and simply return without doing anything if the player's role did not match the optionset.If the ability for triggers to set a default set of roles (thus obviating the need for role-based trigger conditions, though that's an optional enhancement, imo), that would be handled when generating the UI options, in much the same way that triggers can define the default alert text, duration, etc (which can then be overridden by the user).Can you not see how there's a world of difference in the effort required between copying 70+ triggers, probably per expansion, versus implementing a single approach in a common function that automatically applies to all triggers merely by virtue of their existing templating?

My intuition says no?

It no longer appeared when doing any content whatsoever. I was able to get the test timeline to appear by doing a countdown on a Striking Dummy though.As of today, neither timeline nor triggers work for me at all now, even the test ones. I thought maybe it was because I was still using hibiyasleep's overlay plugin, so I switched to the ngld overlay plugin in the latest release and copied over my user folder. No change, aside from having a different overlay.The timeline likely doesn't work because the CactbotOverlay addon from the hibiyasleep release is incompatible with the ngld release, so I can't add it to the OverlayPlugin tab like I did before.I even tried adding a regex to my raidboss user file to capture and log everything, but for some reason it doesn't log anything.Options.Triggers = [{zoneRegex: /.*/,triggers: [{regex: /.*/,infoText: function(data, matches) {console.log(data); // Doesn't log anythingreturn;}}]}];I disabled the hibiyasleep overlay plugin and restarted ACT before adding and initializing the ngld overlay plugin.The ngld overlay plugin files are in their own folder, separate from the hibiyasleep overlay plugin files.My OverlayPlugin tab has no errors in the log.My Plugins:Assembly Info:FileName: C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\Advanced Combat Tracker\\Plugins\\FFXIV_ACT_Plugin.dllOriginalFilename: FFXIV_ACT_Plugin.dllFileVersion: 2.0.4.4ProductVersion: 2.0.4.4FileDescription: ACT Plugin for Final Fantasy XIVLegalCopyright: \u00a9 2019 RavahnAssembly Info:FileName: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Advanced Combat Tracker\\ngld_OverlayPlugin\\OverlayPlugin.dllOriginalFilename: OverlayPlugin.dllFileVersion: 0.10.1.0ProductVersion: 0.10.1.0FileDescription: OverlayPluginProductName: OverlayPluginLegalCopyright: Copyright \u00a9 RainbowMage 2015, Kuriyama hibiya 2016, ngld 2019Comments: Overlay plugin for Advanced Combat TrackerAssembly Info:FileName: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Advanced Combat Tracker\\ngld_OverlayPlugin\\cactbot\\CactbotOverlay.dllOriginalFilename: CactbotOverlay.dllFileVersion: 0.12.2.0ProductVersion: 0.12.2.0FileDescription: CactbotOverlayProductName: CactbotOverlayLegalCopyright: Copyright 2017Anyone else encounter behaviour like this before?

I(SMN) was in a group with a SCH and noticed that it confused me with the scholar and vice versa. To be more precise, in my dps overlay it said \"YOU\" at the scholar's bar and my dps bar had just my name like it was another player on it...maybe it confused us because we have some equal abilities, for instance miasma, bio, shadowflare etc...or it could be a bug in general? Unfortunately I didn't ask the scholar if it was the other way around on his end.But as soon we started with Ozma more weird things happened. Cactbot didn't give me any alerts when I had the meteor, THEN when the scholar got it, it told me that I have it........I used to trust act and cactbot alot but this was mindblowing. I'm glad that I did react fast enough, otherwise i would've died for no reason.Is there anything I can do to fix that, maybe some wrong settings etc.? If not, I hope that you can take a look at it.

That is why I contacted you first ^^ For other plugins, I use the build in Overlay for target/focus hp numbers, two cactbot-type(dps&raidboss) and a ping overlay from noisy fox.I understand that its not a common issue- happend to me only once too, but isn't there a way to prevent that from happening in future? For now, i guess, all I can do is restart ACT, or clear all data and reload the overlays if something like this happens again.Can you contact ravahn about this, since you have more knowledge about the plugins and can point him to specific lines in the log? Also I think you can explain it much better then I ever could :)E: Just checked the log. I got the Bomb without notification from cactbot not meteor, sorry. "

Every built-in trigger that has a text/sound output should have an id so it can be disabled. User-defined triggers need not have one.I would propose adding to it so that it reads something like this:An id string for the trigger, used to disable triggers. Every built-in trigger that has a text/sound output should have an id so it can be disabled. User-defined triggers need not have one.Because the current structure for Regexes/NetRegexes no longer requires that the ability/effect/whatever name be present as part of the expression, it is extremely important that that information is somewhere alongside. Recommended practice is either to have the effect/ability/NPC name in the trigger ID itself, or in an explanatory comment alongside. Context solely from the trigger body is not necessarily sufficient!I haven't seen this as being a big problem, necessarily, since most of us are already careful to give triggers descriptive IDs. However, I feel like it should be In The Documentation Somewhere. We lose nothing by making descriptive IDs/comments a standard, and we potentially gain from it.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

The overall goal here is to bring a universal structure to log lines, rather than the absolute chaos we have now. Ultimately this will be a good thing, but it does mean that timelines will break, since they fully rely on the differences in structure between the different log line types.The new structure will be[14:47:01.593] StartsCasting 14:10686258:Paprika Rika:4095:Glare:400011C5:Striking Dummy:2.46:-640.06:-850.17:32.15:0.97This will necessitate changes to every currently existing timeline, as well as modifications to our current tools. We still haven't been able to rewrite our timeline tools to take advantage of netRegexes, and with 6.0 now being under two weeks away, we don't have time for that, so we will have to make changes to our existing Python utilities to handle the new format. That part is probably relatively simple.The larger issue is that of rewriting the existing timelines to match the new log line format. Currently, make_timeline emits timeline entries that will match zoneseal game log lines, 15/16 ability lines, and 22 targetable/untargetable lines. However, timelines can use basically any of the existing log lines, so we'll have to have a process in place to ensure everything gets correctly converted.We will probably have to take this in several steps.Sort out which timelines have only simple entries from make_timelineWrite an auto-converter and convert those timelines.Go through the remaining timelines and hand-convert them or special-case a converter for them.Modify the existing utilities just enough to match the new log line format.(And of course before 6.2 we should be able to rewrite the timeline utilities entirely.)I'll try to get us an idea of how many timelines have \"non-basic\" log line regexes in place over the next week. Getting hard numbers for step 1 above is needed before we do anything else.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

In most cases, it will display normally while the spot is 'unidentified fishing hole', but once the name is revealed, the timer freezes and doesn't update for that hole again.I've managed to isolate it to a few fishing spots in Ultima Thule, all of which are using Greek letters (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3).For example, the timer for Limne 18 displays fine, but Limne 3-\u03b1 does not - or 3-\u03b2, apohelos 18-\u03b2, etc etc. It displays normally while any of these were 'unidentified', but once the name was revealed with the Greek lettering, the overlay seemed to not know what to do with it.At the time of this report, the last update hasn't fixed it, so I think it simply slipped through. My ACT parsing language is set to English, as well. ACT logs look normal on the \"you cast your line at [fishing hole] chat messages as well, and ACT's as up to date as can be.I unfortunately can't seem to provide any screenshots of the 'frozen' overlay either, because...the timer just doesn't show up on the affected locations.

For example, being able to copy and paste a trigger from a trigger file into your user/raidboss.js and then modifying what you wanted there.I'm proposing override: true as a new field in a trigger.If set to true, then any previously specified triggers with that id are fully disabled (not just hidden).If you have multiple triggers with the same id and with override: true the last one specified will win and all previous will be disabled.I think it's important to fully disable and not just hide, so that people copying and pasting full triggers will not generate double side effects from any JavaScript code.(I think override: 'id' is a possibility too, but gets awkward if you have multiple user triggers overriding the same id? Then they both would run? At least with override: true the new trigger must have the same id as the old trigger, and so if you've copied and pasted multiple people's approaches to the same trigger, then only one will apply?)(I guess another approach would be to have a TriggerOverrides field on Options instead of just Triggers and implicitly anything in there overrides the same thing with the same id, but I'm not sure I like that any better.It would be a cleaner copy and paste, but it would also be more implicit.)I could also imagine override: true, but on the trigger set entirely if somebody wants to copy and paste the whole thing? I think there would need to be some logic around handling the timeline file path here.I think mostly I'm bringing this up because I feel like my previous overriding approaches have been super hacky.I think I would prefer to get rid of the \"condition / text overriding\" if possible, as I think this override: true approach would allow you to do all of that more cleanly.However, given the detritus of different approaches that haven't really worked out, I wanted to float this idea and see if anybody had criticisms, opinions, better ideas to make it easier to change text / conditions of triggers.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

I would suggest that we might want the override parameter to default true rather than false, however. Based on peoples' expectations in the ACT Discord server, I feel like that's the behavior most are expecting. Principle of Least Astonishment etc.I very specifically like the idea of being able to hand users something to copypasta, since a number of the users I know personally are not terribly familiar with navigating text editors at all. Telling them \"look for the [WHATEVER] keyword, find the brace next to it, insert a line below, and copy [THIS] there\" could be significantly easier. Obviously that's not an ideal situation, since now they have potential cruft in their user file, but it is at least usable. "

Based on peoples' expectations in the ACT Discord server, I feel like that's the behavior most are expecting. Principle of Least Astonishment etc.Thanks, I was a little bit reluctant to go this implicit route, but I think it's the best.I think the biggest negative to defaulting the override parameter to true is that there may be some people who have copypasta'd in the past and have duplicate trigger ids that aren't correct.In the sense that they copied trigger A, but made new trigger B but used id A, and so now trigger A is now disabled unexpectedly.So, this will be a breaking change.I think it's ultimately the right decision, though.The more I think about it, the more I am unsure what the use case of override: false is.The only one I can think of is preventing future id collisions (i.e. if another trigger gets added with the same id in the future, then this one won't be disabled).It also prevents your triggers from being overridden.For example if a dev distributes an additional set of triggers that people can add to their user folder, then override: false would prevent them from being overridden, in the logical equivalent of final for triggers.It's arguable whether that's a valid use case.In summary, I think the plan here is that duplicate ids will automatically override any previously loaded trigger with that id.It willemit a log entry (maybe only in debug raidboss mode? maybe always??) when a trigger is overloaded.There will be no override field, and this will all just be implicit behavior for triggers.I think maybe for user folders we'll load in alphabetical order, so folks can control the order and overriding of triggers.

(Frameworks mask all the important bits.)With the new user file paradigm, I am definitely liking the persistence of my changes across updates! But I have been having a couple issues with some code.I tend to modify triggers in simple ways. I like to copy-paste the triggers from the data js files (e.g. e12s.js), and then make those modifications. When copying a few triggers, recently, I was getting a few null-reference/undefined errors. I had copied constants that were defined in the e12s.js file, and thus were not in global scope (tangent enhancement request). It would be nice if such global were exported, but not required as I can simply redefine them. However, I could not find a way around the Outputs being undefined (e.g. copying 'E12S Promise Junction Shiva').I had tried importing Outputs, just like the e12s.js file did, but seeing as file references are different, that did not work. Then I tried using relative filepath from my user folder. That did not work. Then I tried as if it was in the ui/raidboss/ directory (like sound file references). Then I tried a direct, full filepath reference. ....Still nothing, all with the same error:Unexpected identifier at loadUser (<filepath>/cactbot/dist/config.bundle.js:1:41226) (<filepath>/cactbot/dist/config.bundle.js)...I since figured out a workaround for what I was doing, but I figured it was worth mentioning this hole I found with user files. ...Or I am doing something wrong.

I'd forgotten about \"unknown lookup from XIVAPI\", that might affect what I'm doing with the translation tools right now, so definitely something to think about.On auto-selecting the timeline for test_timeline, that's probably doable but would require a bit of restructuring. Currently, the script has no way of \"knowing\" which instance an encounter takes place in at any given pair of timestamps. Further, because -lf is simply looking for any ability to start the encounter, there's no good way to say \"this line tells you which timeline to use\". Off the top of my head, I'm seeing the algorithm working sort of like this:encounter_start = zone_seal_or_attack_lineif encounter_start is zone_seal:search_timelines_for_zone_seal(zone_seal)else search_timelines_for_attacker_NPC(attack_line)That's probably not the best way to go about it, but given that there is no standard convention on how to name timeline/trigger files, I don't see a way to avoid reading through the raidboss directory to find the start line if we do something like this.The other option is to build a map of instance/filename pairings and keep it updated. Then we could just have -lf silently include the instance name when an encounter is specified, look it up from the map, and select the timeline file from there. It would be more manual work to update this every patch, but it would save time iterating through the raidboss folder to find the appropriate timeline every time the script is called. (The other other option here would be to save state across calls, but that's well beyond what I'm able to do.) "

Scripts can be written to update old timelines with ability aspect, but someone would be volunteering their time to go back and record if an ability hits 2 players, creates puddles, is a divebomb, etc.An additional note: Cactbot is the only known consumer of the original timeline format; if it makes sense to extend the format or change it to suit the needs of the community going forward, that can be accomplished as well but will again require a non-zero level of effort to retrofit old fights.Any ideas, feedback, and/or input would be greatly appreciated!The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

For most of the mechanics, the timeline already has ability IDs associated to sync to, so I feel that while it could be more work, it would definitely be less breaking to put together a lookup table of IDs vs timeline icons. This table could also contain the damage type information for different colors/patterns on the timeline display. There could even be an exceptions section for mechanics that are based on RP lines.The benefit, as I see it, is that there would be no need to make changes to timeline generation workflow, and all existing timelines should Just Work, if potentially without the new functionality. Additionally, as long as the timeline format continues to use ability IDs to sync, the proposed framework addition should in theory be future-proof.The downside, of course, is needing to develop this framework and build the lookup table. Additionally, there would be ongoing maintenance in that someone would have to add new ability IDs as Square implements them.Overall, I think that even if the initial time investment to do modified timelines through a framework addition is high, it would be worth it in future, as opposed to changing timeline formats. This is of course assuming that Quisquous/the community decide this feature should happen at all. "

I'm not sure what the right answer is here, but I could see this being confusing.There's also a skin for timeline types, and it'd be nice for people to be able to style these different types as they saw fit if they wanted.iconsI think the icons are neat, but I worry about icon overload, where you have so many icons that they become nonsensical.I think it'd be better to have a small number of icons (and most things without icons).I'm thinking tankbuster, aoe, stack, in, out, maybe a few others?But things that if you are watching the timeline, but can't quite remember the fight because it's been a while, you can be like \"oh yeah that's what the tankbuster is called in this fight\" and maybe prepop something before the trigger happens.

If you double down, you can have magical (mage staff), physical (sword), and unaspected or TBD (idk, I just put a line).If you tripled down, you could include icons for tank only, healer only, and DPS only mechanics. However, I think you can convey enough of this information with the timeline text.An alternative that I don't personally think is much better would be to convey the information via subtext:Earthen Fury________5- AoE DamageEarthen Anguish___10- TankbusterEspecially since the triggers will almost always convey this information to you, but the triggers usually aren't synchronized to the timeline itself, but instead to the network logs. They can be synchronized with the timeline, but I think that's much more fragile.I think the icons can be an elegant way of solving the different damage types, but it starts to fall apart the more icons people would want. Anything above 2 icons is at the point where the timeline is conveying too much information in my opinion, and players would probably rather just see what happens or what the trigger says.For my own personal opinion, I think that any additional information we decide to include should not draw away from the main timeline and should just be useful reference material for the one or two times you're (re)learning the mechanic and then you should be able to ignore them entirely after that.

I use razer synapse (razer surround) as my default windows sound output device (I guess this will be kinda similar in function as your voice meter). So in addition to what I mentioned in the previous post when I game and wanted to record game play with OBS where I do not want triggers and sound alerts to be recorded my setting are:(These are set within the software itself not under windows 10 sound settings)Windows default output: Razer Surround Audio Controller (Razer Synapse)Razer Synapse: HeadsetOBS Desktop Audio Device: Razer Surround Audio Controller (Razer Synapse)Discord Output: Razer (If I wanted to record voice chats) and Headset (when I don't)One other thing to mention is that the TTS (be it from cactbot, built in trigger, Special Spell Speed, Ultra scouter etc..) and the \"sound alerts\" from cactbot are separate things. The method I mentioned in the previous post I only use it for the cactbot sound alerts and as for TTS I actually use act NUSOUND plugin to control TTS output devices https://github.com/zinx/NuSound (though setting through windows 10 should still be possible, I never tried as I had this plugin long before I installed cactbot).If your setting are similar my suggestion is to change every programs' output under windows 10 sound setting to headset and then turn them back to whatever sound device they were on one by one and see which program is actually outputting cactbot to your virtual voice meter (could be chrome as quisquous did mention something about cactbot sounds are played through chrome though for me I don't have to change chrome's output device).

I would hope that it is not too hard to translate things in JavaScript files, but I am somewhat biased here because I am a programmer.But, I think the presence of somebody like VanSlanzar who is not a programmer speaks well to other people being able to pick it up and copy surrounding code.One very big downside to having things in a file is that there is already confusion about what a particular mechanic means, and having translations in separate sheets and projects farther away from the code will make it harder to understand what \"dorito stack\" or \"pepperoni\" mean.I think the hard part of cactbot translations is the replacement restrictions (collisions, tests, etc) and general regex knowledge.I don't think a separate translation sheet will help with either of these problems.One thing that I think has helped translations is to have resources/responses.js as well as ui/raidboss/common_translation.js.I think another thing that will help along the lines of what @MaikoTan asked for is to do something like this #1307 (comment) for common translations.I personally don't think it's worth doing this for absolutely everything, but just things that get used multiple times.That will just cut down on the total number of translations that are needed overall.Sorry for the skepticism, but I am just not convinced that an approach like this solves enough problems in my mind to be worth the extra cost to do it.

The solutions noted in the OP (to my mind at least) seem more geared toward projects with a constantly expanding base of content requiring translation. For cactbot, the \"base translated content\" is going to be relatively slow to update, and the benefit of these outside solutions would be small. In this situation, I think the solution MaikoTan and I proposed might take less overall overhead. The way such a file would be structured should be reasonably understandable even by non-programmers with a little explanation. Obviously translations that take parameters might not be so easy, but simple stuff like \"Stack With Partner\" ought to be doable for just about anyone.(Additionally, if in the future we do need to convert over to a dedicated translation CMS, it should in theory be simple enough to extract the translation functions and returned objects.)

This turns off the scaling and thus gets rid of the glitches but it obviously doesn't scale anymore.@quisquous The zoom slider hasn't been released, yet. I have to fix a few issues with the new curl downloader (or revert it) before I can push another update.The best solution I could figure out so far would be to render the overlays in a separate subprocess which could then do the scaling itself but that adds additional IPC overhead and makes the whole thing more complicated. I'll eventually implement that due to other issues with CEF in the ACT process but it's going to take quite some time to finish. "

If two players that get gaols are in the override, the one that comes first (left-most in the array) would have \"priority\" (read: closest to Titan), allowing you the option to specify a strict order for the whole party or just a \"yea, I really only care about this one melee's GCDs\".Quick edit: To be perfectly clear, this functionality does not currently exist; but, it could with some thought and a quick code change (and documentation).

Mechanic names and boss names can similarly be substituted out if we wanted that functionality as well.This, combined with a rudimentary dictionary of common Cactbot phrases plus their translation counterparts (I'm envisioning copy/paste, but it could ultimately live in a map within the code as well), could probably reduce the translation time and effort necessary for fights. An example would be standardizing all raidwide damage to be \"aoe\" and its non-English equivalents, etc.The biggest drawback I immediately see is that the ids of the triggers themselves would have to be consistently good, since the mechanic name is no longer within the trigger regex itself. Additionally, anyone looking for \u30bf\u30a4\u30c0\u30eb\u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u30d6 wouldn't find it since it's now just .+? and I'm expecting that the trigger ids will never be non-English just due to tradition at this point.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

And I think there are some cases of overlap between players and mobs, but maybe I'm mistaken.Having the name explicitly also makes the regex cheaper, because it doesn't have to backtrack ever and is just a literal string match.All of the timeline syncs are all of the form /:Leviathan:3FF1:/ for 15/16 lines and /:3FF1:Leviathan/ for 14 lines, so cactbot alreayd depends on the \"short\" version.I'm not sure what to do to make it more readable.Maybe the trigger id is enough?

It was just an idea I was playing around with in my head to hopefully get participation barriers lower and get releases to the other locales faster.

Although, it looks like this might be the approach taken by fflogs, since Multi-taillade Chaotique in E2S has the T capitalized on fflogs and its source, garlanddb, has it all lowercase. And, since #531 looks to have specifically targeted the capitalization of one word and not the other, I'm assuming this shotgun approach does not work.If we dropped the spell names, how would we account for starts using <spell> on <player>? With .*? The only other major option I can see currently is adding an i modifier to the regular expressions so that you can translate automatically and have it run case-insensitive. If we took this approach we'd probably want to see about getting the u modifier in as well, for unicode upper/lower-casing, which has only recently been ubiquitously supported. "

Would you have to specify capturing yourself, e.g. Regexes.startsUsing('3A52', 'Neo Exdeath', '(\\y{Name})'),? and then matches[1] is who it is on? Would it be better if matches had names? Like, matches.abilityId and matches.targetName? An unfounded concern is that most things don't match, and maybe auto matching groups is slower? Maybe you need CaptureRegexes.startsUsing('3A52', 'NeoExdeath') if you want capturing or some such? A bit more thought needed here.On a similar note, it might be good to have canned conditions and canned responses? Condition-wise, there's a lot of repeated \"do I care about tankbusters\" or \"do I care about aoes\" or \"is this on me\".Response-wise, there's plenty of translations that we could build in and just have a function like Responses.getOut() or ResponsesStackOn(matches[1]).I'm not sure I have all the answers here, but it does just seem that sort of adding more testing so that regexes are precise is not the answer, and it might be better to have another layer of abstraction here.

When I have more time tonight, I'll go through and make a list of what I've typically found... not painful, precisely, but annoying, in terms of \"blah, this is the same stuff again\".The one concern I might have is that abstracting all this could cause issues for newer contributors. (As an example, Responses.stackOn([TARGET]) might be a pitfall in the case of tank-only markers, or markers where [ROLE] shouldn't stack. As a parallel example, you might remember that there was a time when data.role was split into tank, healer, dps-melee, dps-ranged, and dps-caster. I hadn't dug deeply enough into how data.role was implemented, and just tried a condition like data.role != 'dps'. It was caught during review, but it wasn't obvious to me at all until pointed out. Not insurmountable by any means, but definitely needs consideration.)On regexes-as-functions, I think it's probably worth auto-capturing unless there's a significant performance hit. From the perspective of the contributor, it's irrelevant whether something gets matched but never used, while consistency in indexing for each element seems like a significant benefit. (So for instance, if I were putting together a standard 14: trigger, knowing that the target will always be matches[INDEX] seems like it would make things easy for contributors. It might also make errors easier to catch at review or even programmatically, because we would know that an ability code match should only ever be at such-and-such an index in matches.) The downside is that we wouldn't have that consistency across different log lines, but I think it's still worthwhile. "

Maybe make the responses take a popup_level parameter for infoText, alertText, or alarmText?One other response that's really common but at the same time is complex is Responses.moveToPositionRelativeToBoss(), and I'm not sure what the best way to handle it is.

Personally, I think it should be an object of functions just like Responses. This would maintain commonality with how the rest of the replacement elements work. However, because of stuff like 'stack on ' + matches.target we would need to figure out some way to pass that information to these functions. As I see it, we have two options there:Nest functions horribly:let LocaleText = {stackOnTarget: () => {let intermediaryFunction = (data, target) => {return {en: 'Stack on ' + data.ShortName(target),de: 'Auf ' + data.ShortName(target) + ' sammeln',fr: 'Packez-vous sur ' + data.ShortName(target),ja: data.ShortName(target) + '\u306b\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30af',cn: '\u9760\u8fd1 ' + data.ShortName(target) + '\u96c6\u5408',ko: '\uc250\uc5b4\uc9d5 \u2192 ' + data.ShortName(target),};}return intermediaryFunction;}}The advantage to this is that no matter what, we could call LocaleText functions in exactly the same way we would any other replacement, and they would just work. (Here, we would write alertText: LocaleText.stackOnTarget().) The downside is that it's just so bad.Or, option 2:let LocaleText = {stackOnTarget: (data, target) => {return {en: 'Stack on ' + data.ShortName(target),de: 'Auf ' + data.ShortName(target) + ' sammeln',fr: 'Packez-vous sur ' + data.ShortName(target),ja: data.ShortName(target) + '\u306b\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30af',cn: '\u9760\u8fd1 ' + data.ShortName(target) + '\u96c6\u5408',ko: '\uc250\uc5b4\uc9d5 \u2192 ' + data.ShortName(target),};},}This makes sense and doesn't nest any extra functions. Unfortunately, we now have to remember how to call each LocaleText function. (\"Does it take 1 argument? 2? I'm not sure, I gotta look at the LocaleText file again\".) We would call this as alertText: LocaleText.stackOnTarget(data, matches.target). That still saves the tons of vertical space we want, but it does tend to creep over horizontally.Maybe I'm overthinking this and we could figure out a good way to just return bare text objects? I feel like limiting this to stuff that doesn't require access to data or matches might make stuff harder in the future, but there's of course the very reasonable counterpoint \"that's what responses is there for!\"Sorry this is so rambly. I've not had a lot of luck sitting down and putting something really solid together, so I'm instead just trying to get some thoughts written down in hopes someone else can make something good out of the pieces.(Also, to be clear, I'm not taking this as a situation where I feel that LocaleText is settled, just that I'm using it as a placeholder until we do work that out.)

I've tried extracting with WINrar and other zip programs, extracting them to the ACT folder, and I've also tried just copying and dragging it over to the ACT folder, and also copying and pasting. But none of these methods have worked for me.I'm using all the up to date githubs, and are all in the right places (also note that ive tried just making another folder in windows(C:) and try to not use program files (x86) but that didnt work either)But still no option for cactbot in dropdown "

In order for her to begin this soft enrage, she has to be in Ryne form. If she's in frost form at the time the threshold is reached, she will complete her current mechanic and then immediately use Redress (4F4F) --> Shining Armor (4DF1) --> Absolute Zero (4DD7). This is then followed up with repeated 4DD7 casts until she or the party die.Unfortunately, these abilities are identical to the ones used during her standard rotation. This means we can't just use a full-fight lookbehind sync to catch them, as we do for some others. (An example of a similar issue is in Hades Normal.) We discussed some potential solutions to this, but for the moment it looks like that has landed incomplete.Currently, I think the \"best\" solution is to split the rotation block in two so that each one ends with Absolute Zero, and then add a junction to each. This would either point back to the start of the other block, or invisibly lead to the enrage block via jump.

One thing the timeline syntax currently allows for is arbitrary ordering of lines, and that would break if this were implemented in a relative fashion.

If I understand it correctly.I had the idea of using localStorage to store the settings information for the current user.We could, in theory, append these steps to sync to the localStorage.We would still have the priority system as it is now, but the localStorage would be the final settings location for all of this. If the values didn't exist in localStorage, they would be loaded and then localStorage would be created as part of this process. If they did exist, they would override the settings just as the user settings folder does now.LocalStorage -> user\\raidboss.js -> raidboss.jsWe could create an EXPORT/IMPORT function to store the LocalStorage values and this could make it easy for a raid-group to share settings, or custom triggers if added to UI at some point.Some downsides to this method obviously do exist, for example if someone clears all browser data it could delete these settings.This would have an advantage though for people using the current version hosted on GitHub, the localStorage settings would be able to work pretty seamlessly.Other related thoughts:I had thought it would be neat to extend the UI to add custom triggers, name overrides, adding new triggers could also be done, with some preset conditions for non-technical types. Of course at some point I think it would be ideal to be able to store these locally and you would need some backend to deal with that.I'm not entirely sure what functionality you can extend within the context of the actual DLL.

So maybe hitting such a \"Config\" button would need to pop up another entirely separate overlay that's big enough for the config?An alternative to all of this would be to have a separate config html file that folks would have to add as a separate overlay if they wanted to configure any of the overlay types, but that seems a bit cumbersome for a tool that's supposed to be making it easier.

It might also be enough to just say \"this trigger outputs Alarm\" or \"Alert or Info\" etc.I also feel a little bit that if folks want to write their own triggers, that cactbot isn't necessarily the easiest way to do that? cactbot's trigger system is flexible, localized, and something that can be checked into source control, but it's also super complicated.If you're not a programmer, then it's not that easy to write.(And if you're not a programmer, I'd probably suggest just writing ACT or triggernometry triggers than adding cactbot ones?) And, if you are a programmer, then probably it's not too hard for you to go add that JavaScript yourself.I don't quite know who the audience would be for writing trigger in a config tool.Also, the o9s image looks nice, but my only thought is that you're signing yourself (or me) up for a lot of ongoing work whenever new things come out.Unrelated to anything else, I suspect that things you'd want on a per trigger basis would be:turn this trigger off entirelyplay/don't play tts for this trigger, ignoring global settingsplay/don't play sound for this trigger, ignoring global settingsshow/don't show text for this trigger, ignoring global settingsWith the thought being that maybe folks set up global settings for most of what they want and then flip switches on individual triggers that they want to behave differently? I do that for tts when I don't normally have it on.I also suspect folks will probably just want to turn a bunch of things off. "

You are right Triggernometry has a bunch of those features for creating smarter triggers, ACT triggers are fine for the more basic ones.I'm going to recap on this some on your thoughts tooImages:The images can actually be harvested from the game files pretty easily so you dont need to crop or edit them or anything. I think it would be one effort per major patch cycle to get those images and a number of tools exist to help with that already. I would estimate the effort to be less than half an hour if you are already setup.Alternatively and possibly better we could pull the images from XIVDB or Garland tools which have APIs for dealing with that stuff.I think the biggest thing a config tool can do for people is toCreate a personal config fileOverride default callout functionality.I wonder if being able to purely \"view\" the triggers logic would be nice? If so, I would say that it would be best if we kept it hidden until a user asks to see it.It may help with people reporting issues with specific triggers or not understanding what they should expect to get from the output, or do you think that would just be confusing too?Thanks again!

I was trying to think of any easy way to print out examples of all the triggers, but it all just felt really redundant to the triggers themselves and not any easy way to automate it all.That seems easiest.it probably doesn't need to be shown by default.I suspect that the vast majority of folks only care about high level settings.Thanks for all your work here!I see a lot of questions about configuring cactbot (even in this thread itself) and so this tool is going to be really great! \ud83d\udc4d "

If it's not, now we've jumped to a location that may or may not have syncs nearby, and so the timeline is still out of sync. This would mean we would end up putting wide sync windows at the start of phase loops, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn't solve anything. We might as well just put a wide sync at the loop point as we currently do for jump anyway.That being said, it just now occurred to me that if loop behaves conditionally as jump does now, a situation that could happen is that users see a timeline displayed at 359, and then when the timeline advances one second, and the sync is missed, suddenly the timeline disappears. That would be less desirable. We could of course fix it with a wide sync window on the keyword line, as we do now, but that might be a decent argument in favor of unconditionality. "

                "content": "DescriptionThe bug occurs when:Fresh ACT + overlayplugin + cactbot installUsing 1x Default Cactbot Raidboss Alert Only, AND/OR 1x Default Cactbot Raidboss Timeline OnlyWhile raiding (P5S - P8S)While Cactbot is working (during the raid encounter), randomly the bug occurs. It happens about 1 time per pull, sometimes multiple times, sometimes not at all. It can also happen before a pull (during countdown or just standing around and discussing strategy). But it seems to never happen outside of raid zones (for example at FC house or limsa).The bug symptoms:ALL my keyboard inputs are being delayed (lagging behind) by about 1 to 5 seconds. For example, I start walking forward (W key down), then the bug occurs, then I stop walking (W key up). Due to the bug, the (W key up) is delayed by about 1 to 5 seconds, which means I cannot stop walking. I watch my character walk off the map or into a mechanic and die.Another example: I press enter and start typing a sentence. I look at the chat window and it's empty, because the bug occured. I stop typing. 5 seconds later, a ghost is typing my sentence into the chat window, at exactly the same speed as I wrote it on the keyboard. So the time between keypresses is normal, except they're all delayed by a very large amount.After a random time (feels like 3 to 8 seconds), the bug dissappears and all my inputs are instant again.Additional informationFrom what I can tell, all keys on my keyboard are delayed. For example Alt+Tab will also be delayed, and even after the alt+tab completes, the bug still continues.Mouse input still works normally, only keyboard is affected.I'm using a normal wired mechanical USB keyboard. (nothing bluetooth that could drop connection)It only happens in FFXIV with ACT running with the cactbot plugin enabled. If I disable the cactbot plugin, it doesn't happen anymore. I've raided the first 3 weeks of the patch without cactbot and it never happened then. As soon as I enabled it after week 3, it started happening consistently.It's a modern computer (Windows 11 21H2, AMD Ryzen 7 2700X, Nvidia RTX 2080), so it's not a performance issue. There are no FPS drops during the bug (always around 100 FPS). I don't have any bad software running in the background, watching task manager shows normal operation during the bugIt doesn't matter whether I use TTS or not, so it's not TTS relatedI disconnected my controller, so it can't cause itI'm using FFXIV QuickLauncher with Dalamud, not sure if that makes a differenceI have many video recordings of the bug, but you'd just see me running around stupidly in the middle of a fight and cancelling my own casts, so it doesn't help muchI have a feeling the announcer causes the problem more often than the timeline, but I confirmed that both cause it.I've been trying to isolate or fix this bug for the past 2 weeks, I'm at my wit's end, please help. If there's anything I can provide you with, I'll do it.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

I check Task Manager and ACT uses 100% of my CPU!Since this time the bug didn't fix itself after a few seconds, I observed it and found the following:The huge input lag is a byproduct of 100% CPU usage. I still get high FPS (this apparently only depends on GPU performance), but most ingame actions are extremely janky. All movement is delayed, other players and models don't load in anymore, if I use my mount then I'm invisible for 5 seconds until finally the mount loads in, other players casts are either not happening at all, or then suddenly all happen at once (I saw their castbars in the party list flicker extremely quickly between like 10 different skills)After about 2 minutes, ACT gave the error notification: Log Parsing lagging behind. Log line parsing has been behind for 10 seconds. A plugin subscribed to BeforeLogLine/OnLogLine may be processing synchronously and taking too long. I assume this plugin is Cactbot, because that's the only one I have installed, other than the overlayplugin (fresh install, not using any features except the cactbot announce+timeline)After another minute, ACT gave the error notification \"Failure: Unable to access network data. This may be due to Windows Defender Firewall [...]\". (My firewall rules are fine and I don't run any antivirus or firewall software, this is probably another byproduct of the 100% CPU usage)when I alt-tab into ACT, even my mouse cursor starts having extreme lag. The mouse cursor updated at like 1 FPS and took half a minute to complete a simple movement.I think it's clear that cactbot locks itself in an infinite calculation loop, which may be during BeforeLogLine/OnLogLine, and usually exits the loop after about 3 to 5 seconds. What could this be?Edit: I've uploaded the log after this occurence:Network_26606_20220929 - Copy.logThe bug started occuring somewhere between 2022-09-29T22:33 and 2022-09-29T22:40, I'm not sure.

Maybe something is going awry with that call?What is your DPS update interval seconds and Enmity update interval ms in Plugins -> OverlayPlugin.dll -> Event Settings? Can you turn those way up to like 10 seconds and 10000ms and test with that? Maybe a high update rate is causing C# garbage collection issues which in turn is causing issues with cactbot?If you just have the cactbot plugin but no overlays using cactbot, does the issue occur?I think it would also be worth doing a test without Dalamud, and also listing which plugins you're using.

But I've read online and heard from some people that it could cause slowdowns even in that case? Not sure I believe it.I also noticed that I get the same kind of keyboard lag right when I start the computer, while it's still loading the OS. If I instantly open the browser and type into the address bar, the numbers appear very slowly and delayed like during the ffxiv bug. But after a few seconds the computer finishes loading and things stay normal from then on.

The point is to facilitate a strat with no swap.Ah, I see.I missed that part of your strat description.No, if you select 'BPOG', the Actual call you'll get will still invert the position before giving you the call (that's how it works for all of the current drop-down pair order choices) -- so, if for example you're the blue X, your 'Actual' call would correspond to the far right/east column (e.g. GOPB).That should be a fairly easy tweak, but it is a more fundamental concept change than just calling out the final/actual position, so I think the checkbox to enable it should probably be more descriptive than just \"don't call initial\".Does this strat have a name?Or do you have a link to a toolbox or guide, something than can be added to the comments?

I think this started happening either with the current version (.15.2) or one or two previous where it's no longer working. I think it was when the overhaul/addition to managing customized settings was added into the ACT interface.I'm on FFXIV plugin 2.0.4.13 and ngld Overlay plugin 13.2.0. Net framework looks to be version 4.8.The \"Cactbot Event Source\" tab of the OverlayPlugin.dll doesn't load, it just comes up blank:Additionally when I try to add new overlays and select any of the cactbot ones, they do appear, but they don't interact with the game (e.g. load raidboss, go to summerford, /bow, /countdown, nothing) - both when pre-selecting or when trying to add a custom one, it's the same.I DID previously have minor customizations in a \\user file to turn off all the alerts and pop-ups etc. as I only wanted the visual timeline for vods - so in case that was the issue I removed my old version of cactbot entirely, did a fresh download/unblock/extract/install with no user file, and it's the same issue.Not sure what I'm missing?

For Thordan's case, aside from just increasing the delay, there may be work such that we can get data from another NPC, maybe even without OverlayHandler, and perhaps just add delay to it so that its timings do not interrupt other TTS.#4400 for instance (and as has been pointed out in a previous closed PR) there are other methods to determining Thordan's location earlier, just not as straight forward as querying Thordan. I just know that one method involving that same NPC in #4400 with OverlayHandler was getting the data later than when Thordan appears when I tested it out after having wrote the current trigger. "

I've been testing this out on bard, however, and realized really quick that I have no idea how to detect when Mage's Ballad procs or the timer/cooldown status of bloodletter. It's not a super big deal, and I know the mechanic is changing in 5.0, but I was curious about if you'd given this any thought?I took a peek at the plugin code itself (i'm a .NET developer too) but I'm not sure how you came to the memory addresses and such so I'd be down for some tips on how to find that stuff out too.

This just has a text aura start when you enter and adjusts a variable when each scene starts, clears the variable when the countdown <= 0 or you enter combat, and toggles the visibility of the aura in between.I can make it a point to export logs from my next run if it would help.This is what it looks like in Triggernometry:The export of that folder:Triggernometry_Praetorium CS Tasa.zipEDIT:Reading up on the timeline creation more I will add a copy of my network logs the next time I am in an MSQ....

Setting parser language to cn would make the general overlay like kagerou working, but cactbot seems to be not responsive.

Things like this.me are all undefined. I can also see the error log \"Charmap signature found 0 matches\");.I tried hardcoding to use FFXIVProcessIntl instead and things are working with the rebuilt dll.I'm wondering if we can decouple client version from language, maybe as a develop option.

It (seems to me it) would be nice to just be able to search a log for a given marker type rather than sorting through all 1B lines.I envision this as a .js-formatted text file similar to the triggers readme. A sample would be something like this:// 0028// Earth Shaker// Damage cone--don't overlap and don't point at other players// Seen in Sephirot EX, St Mocianne (HARD) and Dun Scaith, among others./ 1B:........:(\\y{Name}):....:....:0028/Obviously this isn't the final revision on the formatting, but it should be a good baseline.

If the raw network line says 4pm PDT, and the converted line says 16:00:00, that's fine. If the network line says 4pm PDT and the converted line says 23:00:00, that's not going to be right.And you're right that this is a problem if you're using a network log created in a different timezone, the impact is really limited though since built-in triggers all use network lines and timelines all use converted lines. If there's ever a mix, it's going to break things with timeline.Option 4 seems to be the least-impactful fix but it won't fix the underlying problem when some time down the road conversion of timeline stuff to network format starts happening.Option 1 could be done in base LineEvent but it'd require bumping the version of the encounter so it would get re-parsed on load. There's also a question of how to handle displaying in emulator, should we display UTC, or display in local timezone? "

Since the first day I've been using Cactbot, from time to time, the whole ACT gets laggy and not fluid like seen on many videos.First of all, here's my setup:i7-7700KGTX 107016GB RAMAlso, I'm using 2 monitors. A 144Hz acer Predator and a 60Hz Philips TV.Then, let me continue with my fix-attempts:First of all, I've tried setting the dps update interval in ACT in the cactbot overlays to 0 instead of default 3, which already helped with some major lags, but didn't solve the problem completely.Then I've read about the NVidia dual screen bug on Win10, that occurs, when one screen has 144Hz and one has only 60Hz. I've tried to fix that like in the link you've posted under another comment, by plugging in the TV into my mainboard (enabled it via BIOS), while the main PC screen is still in the GPU. Also, I've set the Display to 120Hz.Nothing has changed.I've also checked, the CPU priority of ACT in ACT itself and it is set to above normalAnd now I'm a bit clueless, what the problem might be. Things where the lag is noticeable:When I'm using the raidboss plugin, occasionally the lag gets so severe, that callouts or even sound cues get delayed by several seconds. TTS callouts get choppy and especially in combination with the ACT Discord Triggers plugin it barely works consistentlyAlso, bars like in the fisher plugin or the raidboss timeline section fill pretty choppy and un-fluent. I've made a video with my phone (since neither OBS nor Fraps seem to capture the overlay) how it looks:http://sendvid.com/ruxde795Now I'm out of clues, what causes this problem.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

I've googled around and I've found out, that is due to the most recent NVidia Drivers all being trash for FFXIV. I had to roll back from NVidia Driver version 418.91 all the way to NVidia Driver version 388.71 via uninstalling the driver with DDU and manually installing the older driver.This completely fixed all the game-stuttering, but sadly it didn't resolve the Cactbot lags in any way.I've also tried uninstalling and re-installing ACT and cactbot as well, but to no improvement whatsoever.I'm only using the ffxiv parsing plugin and Cactbot, because Cactbot is all I need.

I'm sure there will be some corner cases missing or maybe some new helper functions that are needed.I would be supportive of changing one type at a time or one file at a time, or whatever piecemeal approach makes this easier to get done.However, I think the direction is that I'd like cactbot to use these by default, and I will use them when writing new trigger files.Patches are very welcome.Finally, once this conversion is done, the next step is to use the translation properties that are currently only used for timelines to also be used for triggers.This will likely need a little bit of care and attention as the regexes (even if automatically generated) are still manual and have received manual editing over time and so may not match the translation blocks any more.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

The three units each move to the outside of the arena and then pull out a sword in either their left or right hands. Then they dash across the room, causing massive damage. Players need to stand either in front of their unit or behind their unit. This depends on which side of the units the sword is pulled out on. (All three units always use the same side, right or left).The starts casting skill has an ID of 4FAB and there is a trigger which sends a text alert \"DODGE SWORD CHARGES\". This is not really that useful since it still means figuring out which side to stand on.I believe the game gets a different skill ID for some action they take at some point during the skill activation that would let us determine which side is safe. Once we know this ID, we should be able to program a separate trigger that tells whether to stand in front of or behind the units.I think I made a working pull request that will properly detect this!The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

You say npcName['ADS'][data.options.ParserLanguage] but data doesn't exist in this context.Even if that could get solved, I think ultimately there are still a bunch of types of lines that need translating, game log lines (dialog, zone sealing, zone unsealing), but maybe this would solve the vast majority of it.If the fight only has one actor using '5A7', why key off of name at all?This is also a strong possibility too?

If we go that approach, then that solves data files, but not user files.CC @ngld @valarninThe text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

Downloading a single (or a few) bundle files is much easier (and faster!) than the dozen request I need right now.I'll build a quick PoC to demonstrate how Cactbot+Webpack could look. I'm not sure if OverlayPlugin should handle Webpack but I'll think about it. IMO having a .bat or .ps1 script that installs Node, NPM and everything else into a subfolder (similar to fetch_deps.py) would be a better solution.Regarding subdirectories and the user folder in general, what do you think about adding the following handlers?requestConfigFolder(key, caption, callback)Opens a folder select dialog with the given caption. Once the user has selected a folder, the path is stored in OverlayPlugin's config and the handler calls the passed callback.getConfigFolderFiles(key, callback)If a folder is stored for the given key (see previous event handler), it passes a map of all files contained in the selected folder and any subfolders with their content.If the given key hasn't been used, yet, null is passed to the callback.Each Cactbot overlay could call callOverlayHandler('getConfigFolderFiles', 'cactbot', (files) => ...) on load and would receive the expected config files. Since the files object would contain both files directly in the selected folder and those contained in subfolders, adding support for those subfolders shouldn't be too hard.The button to change the user directory in the Cactbot config would call callOverlayHandler('requestConfigFolder', 'Please select a user folder for Cactbot', (success) => ...); which would then trigger the folder select dialog.This shouldn't require too many changes to Cactbot's code, solves the issue around reading local files (only files inside the user folder are accessible to overlays) and seems like a fairly simple and clean interface.The new handlers and Webpack together would make the fetch() changes and the static web server in WSServer unnecessary since Webpack would already handle the static web server (through webpack-dev-server) and the resource requests (through bundling).EDIT: Read through the previous comments from @valarnin again and I think adding an exclude filter would be a good idea. Not sure if the overlay page should specify it, if I should hardcode reasonable defaults (i.e. .git, *.bak, *~, etc.) or if a combination of both would be best.Also sorry for not responding earlier @valarnin, that ping got lost in the long list of unread stuff (RL kept me away for too long).

If the problem above can be solved, and cactbot is going to support them well, then supporting modded client can be considered, but I think it can not be solved. "

So cactbot can be 100% running.I'm just wondering if there is a better way to support full translation. Or getting some ideas for mod makers.

None of our non-English contributors have that same level of familiarity with the project, and I'm relatively sure quisquous doesn't know all the languages represented here.The other problem I can see is that there is no way to ensure that everyone who does doc translations would be able to do the translation quickly when the English docs are updated. And what do we do if there is just a minor update? It would get very hard, very fast, to ensure that all the docs in all languages say the same thing.I'm not trying to say we should not do this, just that we have to be deliberate about how we approach it.

If people 100% just Can't Do The Wrong Thing, they will either give up or do the right thing. (Or another Very Wrong Thing, but there are only so many signposts we can put up for them.)Maybe it would be helpful to have an explicit \"user trigger guide\" that goes through adding a trigger to user.js? The timeline generation guide is super-detailed, and I think it might be necessary to do that here too. (This was one of the reasons I asked to re-write the main trigger readme in Markdown.)

I suppose you could write a utility to convert them.If it helps explain better, the timeline text files will continue to exist inside the repository exactly as they are today.So, if spespe is using them, then that won't break.However, the text files will be bundled into some raidboss.data.js file via Webpack, and then that js file will be loaded.So, if a user modifies the original text file, the raidboss.data.js file will not get updated, and the cactbot overlay will use the old unmodified original text file unless the user runs the bundling step themselves to update the raidboss.data.js file with their changes.

                "content": "Sorry for the wall of text... I suppose I have strong opinions on JS dev and automation.I'd be happy to see Cactbot use Webpack. Imports would make references between files much clearer than the long <script> list in each .html file. Modern JS features (which you can get through Babel/TypeScript) make life much easier in my opinion. It also makes loading Cactbot over GitHub Pages much faster since it'll significantly reduce the amount of HTTP request needed. If anyone's concerned about Webpack slowing down development, I'd say it does the opposite: If you use webpack-dev-server, it'll automatically rebuild the JS bundle whenever a file changes (takes less than a second) and it'll even handle reloads for you. If you implement HMR, you can even keep the current state through the reload.Regarding the confusion around timelines and triggers: You could just stop shipping the source code since it wouldn't be used anyway. Just ship the bundle files Webpack generates. If people want to modify the source, they should use Git in the first place to manage their changes across updates. At that point adding an additional bundle step to the git merge/rebase steps shouldn't make much of a difference.Making trigger text configurable could be fairly easy IMO. If you add a new property to triggers with a list of templates with placeholders (Get Final Nisi (?), Pass {nisi} Nisi, Pass {nisi} Nisi to {player}, ...), the JS trigger could then just pick a string from that list (or map) and fill in the placeholder. The config UI could then offer options to override the text for simple triggers and a more complicated interface for these triggers where it'd show a list of templates and allow the user to modify/override them.Even with Webpack, I'd keep the manifest. I've seen lots of arguments around automatically discovering source files in folders (see C/C++ build tools like CMake, GN, Meson, etc.) and I'm convinced that it's better to explicitly list any dependencies you have (raidboss would depend on the manifest and the manifest depends on the individual timeline/trigger files). This simplifies the integration in Webpack (just a simple loader that converts the manifest into a list of imports) and it makes watching source files easier. If you want to rebuild the bundle whenever a new timeline is added without the manifest, you'd have to watch the whole folder for new files. If you have a manifest, you can instead watch that as any new timeline/trigger file would have to be added.Regarding the previous issues with npm: The two issues I'm aware of were caused by badly configured environments, not npm itself. The issue with PowerShell was that the user told npm to use PowerShell to process the package.json script commands which doesn't work since PowerShell doesn't support the syntax.The other issue where a script file wasn't found was caused by Git-Bash. I generally try to avoid Git-Bash since it's a wonderful source of headaches. Git4Win uses MSYS2 as their base which is essentially a Cygwin fork. The Git-Bash environment uses Cygwin to emulate certain POSIX behaviors and thus will behave differently than cmd. You generally shouldn't run \"normal\" tools their since this POSIX environment will confuse them. npm detects the Cygwin environment and tries to break out into the normal Windows environment to avoid Cygwin issues. However, to do that it has to convert the Cygwin path /c/... to a Windows path. You can do that with the builtin cygpath tool in Cygwin but Git4Win removed that tool which causes that step to fail. The end result is that the npm bash script (which you launched from Git-Bash) successfully calls node.exe but can't pass a valid path since it can't get it (Git-Bash only supplies to Unix path and the conversion with cygpath fails).If you run the same command from a sane environment (cmd.exe, Conemu, Cygwin, MSYS2, etc.), everything works fine. As a side note, running Windows tools inside a POSIX terminal (like Git4Win's Git-Bash) has other awful side effects and should be avoided as much as possible (Windows tools expect the Windows console API not a POSIX TTY).

There's a lot users don't understand that documents or too stressful to understand English.That's a really good point.@JLGarber was mentioning that probably the user file documentation needs to be improved anyway.Maybe the path here can be add user folder, add overrides, improve documentation, get documentation translated, then merge webpack stuff? I will probably do a release shortly, and I would probably start warning people about this so people can get started now.Re: trigger customization:Making trigger text configurable could be fairly easy IMO. If you add a new property to triggers with a list of templates with placeholders (Get Final Nisi (?), Pass {nisi} Nisi, Pass {nisi} Nisi to {player}, ...), the JS trigger could then just pick a string from that list (or map) and fill in the placeholder. The config UI could then offer options to override the text for simple triggers and a more complicated interface for these triggers where it'd show a list of templates and allow the user to modify/override them.I think ngld's suggestion above is probably the best approach for the future.I think ultimately it's not fair to make users write valid JavaScript in order to customize cactbot.I think probably we will still need the user folder for advanced customization that will never make sense to add to a GUI, but to cover the \"rename output text\" case, I think the approach of breaking out all of the output of a trigger into template strings, and then returning them would be a great approach.We'd also have to figure out how to make this work for responses as well.The downside is that it also means refactoring all of the triggers, and there's a lot of triggers.So, I don't know that I'd want to block Webpack on doing this work.I will file an issue with this idea where we can flesh this out in case anybody is interested in working out it in parallel.To start with, I don't think the position for cactbot should be \"we don't want to learn anything new, ever\". I'm not advocating for that at all! I think the addition of Typescript would be a good thing. I don't really like the addition of Webpack, but I understand why it's going to happen.

I knew it was an option that would solve a number of problems and I have resisted adding it for literally years.I'm reluctant to add additional friction to the project in the form of build steps or conceptual requirements that you have to understand to participate in the project.I think this is my objection to new things.It's not that new things are bad, but my position is to be skeptical and reluctant about adding new dependencies.If we add jquery, then you need to understand how jquery works.If you add React, then you have to understand React.The more dependencies and indirection you have, the more a developer needs to hold in their head to understand the entire system.So, it's an argument for simplicity and resistance to complexity.At any rate, sorry for the digression.I think this React discussion is a getting little bit off-topic for Webpack.I'm happy to discuss in another issue if you'd like to further.Regarding Webpack, there is a dev server.In Panic's #1883 patch, you can run npm run start to start it, and it will serve the files and automatically rebuild when anything changes.Regarding the confusion around timelines and triggers: You could just stop shipping the source code since it wouldn't be used anyway. Just ship the bundle files Webpack generates. If people want to modify the source, they should use Git in the first place to manage their changes across updates. At that point adding an additional bundle step to the git merge/rebase steps shouldn't make much of a difference.I think ultimately the issue is that users aren't developers.It feels already not ok to ask people to write valid JavaScript.Asking them to use git and handle merge conflicts across time seems like even more.I suspect if all users could do this, we wouldn't have ever had questions about customization.I think your idea above about template scripts is a really good one to handle the common use case of trigger output, and should solve most of this.Even with Webpack, I'd keep the manifest. If you want to rebuild the bundle whenever a new timeline is added without the manifest, you'd have to watch the whole folder for new files. If you have a manifest, you can instead watch that as any new timeline/trigger file would have to be added.Thanks for the advice.What's the reasoning behind this feeling? Is there a problem with watching folders vs files? Or, is this a preference for explicit over implicit?If you run the same command from a sane environment (cmd.exe, Conemu, Cygwin, MSYS2, etc.), everything works fine. As a side note, running Windows tools inside a POSIX terminal (like Git4Win's Git-Bash) has other awful side effects and should be avoided as much as possible (Windows tools expect the Windows console API not a POSIX TTY).Thanks for the notice.I didn't realize git-bash caused so many issues.

I don't think this is necessary before converting other triggers to TypeScript, but it might create more work than necessary if it's not solved.The problem is that an individual triggerset's data looks like this:export interface Data extends RaidbossData {fieldOne?: { [key: string]: string };}where fieldOne isn't guaranteed to exist, leading various triggers to inspect if fieldOne is undefined before doing any sort of logic on it. TypeScript won't actually guard here; for instance:export interface Data extends RaidbossData {fieldOne: { [key: string]: string };}won't throw an error, but it would be more correct to add a way to initialize variables we want to be initialized, for example:const triggerSet: TriggerSet<Data> = {init: ((data: RaidbossData) => {return {...data,fieldOne: {},};}),. . .}The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

It's a not-uncommon situation where tank busters don't always work terribly well with caresAbout canned conditions. While these conditions do notify anyone to mitigate, they don't include the \"YOU are the target\" component that's kind of necessary for busters.One suggestion from quisquous was to add a conditionFunc base object to return a boolean from a canned helper, so that we could then return that in a condition like any other comparison. (That is, something like return condFunc.caresAboutMagical() || condFunc.targetIsYou().) This is of course the right way to do it, but I'm not sure whether it's really worth the effort.Panic suggested adding physicalTankbuster and magicalTankbuster as conditions, mapping to matches.target || Conditions.caresAboutX(). This isn't as totally \"correct\", but it's not wrong, and it wouldn't require any actual work. (This has my vote simply because of these factors.)Maybe the best thing is to specialize the tank buster conditions for now, and revisit this in 6.0 if Square adds new mechanics that necessitate new conditions?The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

First timer is okayish but after that it gets out of sync.See gist with network data: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/NielsH/dbcb87eef32aa5f3cb1ada22d6f0b23e/raw/2982bde2217e78e2fa74e5270aa1e5d4c4db5015/gistfile1.txtAnd my attempt: NielsH@0ff5492So my goal here is: Give a timer + warning for when to hide behind the boss. This is when he casts \"Extremely Bad Breath\".The timing of this seems a bit different every time so I cannot just loop. But it seems that 15 seconds after the \"Vine Probe\" mobs spawn he does this. So my goal was: once the Vine probe mobs spawn, display a 15 second timer to indicate when he will do Extremely Bad Breath. This will repeat several times throughout the fight. "

Since Art only uses action 3956 at the start, I think this will not cause anything incompatible. Idk whether Owain has the same problem, just change it too.Then there is the name of Ozma, I'm not sure whether it's caused by some wrong translations mapping, but \"Ozma\" is \"\u5965\u5179\u739b\" in Chinese, and \"Proto Ozma\" is \"\u5965\u5179\u739b\u539f\u578b\".

I am suspecting that this line const roleRaked = data.party.isDPS(matches.target) ?

Folks in CN are also prefer to call a player with their job name rather than their first name, especially when the player named in some uncommon characters that someone didn't know how to read them, unless there are duplicated jobs (And then they would call something like \"\u90a3\u4e2a\u56db\u5b57\u9ed1\u9b54\"(The Black Mage with 4 characters (in his name)) rather than typing the poor BLM's name...).So what I thought is that we can add a job abbreviation after player's name.

There wasn't a lot of data, but @valarnin was kind enough to go through a few things there. It looks like I may have inverted the direction of the Y axis? When I initially set these triggers up, I assumed the arena to be a standard Cartesian layout, with the arena center at 0, -70.Looking through my logs, it appears that the center is 0, -75, based on the positioning of the bomb boulder that drops in the center. According to Valarnin, inverting the \"is this entity north or south\" check resolves the issue for them. That is, bomb.north = parseFloat(matches.y) + 70 > 0 should be changed to bomb.north = parseFloat(matches.y) + 70 < 0.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

Something like:for log_line in file:# Ignore log lines that aren't game status infoif not (log_line[39:42] == '0839'):continue# Build start/end time groupingslog_line_fields = log_line.split('|')if (log_line_fields[4].endswith('sealed off in 15 seconds!')):encounter_starts.append(parse_line_time(log_line))continueif (log_line_fields[4].endswith('no longer sealed!')):encounter_ends.append(parse_line_time(log_line))continueFrom here we can easily return a list of encounter start/end pairs. With a little extra work it should be not-difficult to add the first few NPC names that appear after the zone sealing message to accompany the timestamps. Or we could just add the zone name to the timestamp and let the user work it out from there.(Apologies for the ugly. I'm vastly unfamiliar with Python's file parsing, so I don't know whether the performance benefits of not parsing twice would be worth the effort to extend parse_file cleanly. Nor do I know whether native string methods would be better/worse than regex for this purpose, it's just what I grabbed out of the standard library.)One major benefit of the extra pass would be ease of dropping encounters that are under a certain (potentially configurable) length. If we try to do it all in-line, I feel like it's a little complex to enable listing encounters from within parse_file. Additionally, the extra pass would only need to be incurred if the user wants to avoid using start/end flags, which seems like an acceptable trade-off in that situation.Obviously this currently wouldn't handle single-encounter instances, either. I'm not 100% sure how best to handle that for this sort of thing. Maybe rely on the ENGAGE notification for start and then check for the 21 log line paired with that for end? "

It would potentially lose the ability to make timelines based on those partial encounters, but at that point the user can just specify start/stop points manually.Naively implementing it like this would of course potentially split encounters if a limit break is used during, so perhaps the 0-value limit break can be used as a start point only after a wipe or \"limit gauge resets\" line.

Or I guess we could build timelines for them too...)40000010 wipe indicators and limit resets should also be first-class, obviously. Limit break 0000 messages will indicate the start of a battle IF there isn't already an encounter being tracked.I'm thinking it would work like this:if zone_seal or (0000 limit break and not started):started = Trueif zone_unseal or limit_reset_message or 40000010 wipe or 40000003 victory:started = FalseThis should be effective in all post-ARR light-party content, since those all have zone seal/unseal messages. It should also handle all alliance content for the same reason. Any full-party content should be handled acceptably by the safety of the 0000 limit break not indicating a start point if there's already an active encounter. (Thus, using the limit break, or having a person leave the party shouldn't break things.)Are there any edge cases in existing post-ARR content I'm not seeing here?

(This is just on me prepending the indices before culling rather than after, so that's not going to be an issue on release.)I'm thinking that it may be necessary to check explicitly for \"instance has begun\" before permitting \"is encounter started\", and treat \"instance has ended\" lines as \"encounter has stopped\" in order to avoid the phantom encounters you can see there in non-instanced areas. This is due to 0000 limit break lines sometimes being sent after the 40000003 victory line. (Assuming the player doesn't stay in the instance longer than 60s after the boss dies, the phantom encounter generated by that should be culled automatically. Longer that that, and they would have a phantom encounter, but I'm not sure how to solve that without actively checking for absence of combat lines.)Another thing I'm running into is that datetime objects elide time.microsends by default if the value is 0. It wouldn't ordinarily matter, but it does cause problems if not just listing encounters. I'm having find_fights_in_file return a list of strings, in the basic format of[FIGHT INDEX,START TIME,END TIME,LOCATION]Currently I'm trying to insert at line 103:encounters = find_fights_in_file(file)for line in file:start_time = end_time = 0if args.list_fights:start_time = (encounters[args.list_fights][1])end_time = (encounters[args.list_fights][2]))else:start_time = args.startend_time = args.endAll is fine if the user directly passes start/end times, but because of the elided microseconds in the generated encounter times, the comparison between the timestamp on each line and the generated start time will always fail. (That is, the log line will show 12:34:56.000, while the generated time will show 12:34:56. This is what causes the goofy durations on the listed fights in the sample output I showed above. When the microseconds are elided, the comparisons in the existing code at lines 104-18 will fail.) I could do something horrible like \"if no microseconds, append '.000 after the string conversion but before inserting into the list\", but there's got to be a better way, right?Also, I've been deliberately stripping the date portion of the datetime objects before stringifying them into the lists, but I'm realizing that may not be a good idea. I have my copy of ACT set up to partition by 24-hour periods, so that assumption is sort of reflected in how the times are displayed. It may not be ideal, but the dates take up so MUCH horizontal real estate. What do you think?I'm sorry this wasn't ready before 5.1. I'm hoping to have make_timeline at least to a point where I can reasonably do a draft pull request by Thursday or Friday. (If you like, I can try to put together a draft tonight, since there's maintenance, with fuller explanations on some things, but it's still very much under construction and a number of things in there reflect that.)I haven't really looked into it much, but I expect that once make_timeline is worked out, it will be relatively simple to transfer that work over to test_timeline.

                "content": "One longstanding request is to be able to customize the text output of triggers.Unfortunately this can be really complicated when triggers have so much JavaScript baked in.ngld suggests in #1869 a potential way to make trigger output customizable:Making trigger text configurable could be fairly easy IMO. If you add a new property to triggers with a list of templates with placeholders (Get Final Nisi (?), Pass {nisi} Nisi, Pass {nisi} Nisi to {player}, ...), the JS trigger could then just pick a string from that list (or map) and fill in the placeholder. The config UI could then offer options to override the text for simple triggers and a more complicated interface for these triggers where it'd show a list of templates and allow the user to modify/override them.A half-baked proposal(I'm making this up just to have something to talk about, so feel free to suggest other/better details)Triggers now have a outputStrings field on them.outputStrings is an object that maps keys to trigger text.Trigger text must be either a string or a translatable object of strings, i.e. {en: 'str1', de: 'str2'} etc.It must not be a function.If this new outputStrings field exists, then it changes the trigger into an \"output string only\" trigger.Any infoText / alertText / alarmText / ttsText output must output a key in the outputStrings field rather than outputting the literal text.Then, the trigger would output whatever's in the outputStrings field that corresponds to the key for that trigger.Responses themselves can contain outputStrings.We can also add common ones to resources/translations.js in some new object.Once all/many triggers use outputStrings then we can add configuration UI to override the output of these.We should probably deprecate the Options trigger overrides for text at this point, at least in the sense of removing it from the documentation, and maybe adding console warnings for anybody using it to change to the newer thing.Open questionsIs there any way to verify at build time whether the keys into outputStrings are valid? (i.e. no typos or missing keys)Similarly, it'd be nice to verify that all language have the same set of interpolation fields?How do we validate interpolation fields?What are the set of fields that can be used for template interpolation? Do we allow data and matches? What about custom computed variables from a JavaScript function? The example below assumes that data and matches will be available to the interpolation, but what about other variables? It seems like it'd be better to store some puddleNumber variable for the interpolation to use rather than matches[1] but it also seems not great to have to store them in data directly, muddying that up?Do we make everybody write Stack on ${data.ShortName(matches.target)} as their output string, do we auto-shorten names, do we add new fields?Is there some better way to do this templating other than evaling the output string as a template literal, e.g. eval('`' + outputString['stackOnPerson'] + '`')? These are all user entered, so I'm less concerned about security implications here, but this still seems a bit gross.Hypothetical example:@@ -6,38 +6,42 @@ // data.puddle is set by 'TEA Wormhole TPS Strat' (or by some user trigger). // If that's disabled, this will still just call out puddle counts. if (matches[1] == data.puddle) {-return {-en: 'Soak This Puddle (#' + matches[1] + ')',-de: 'Fl\u00e4che nehmen (#' + matches[1] + ')',-ja: '\u61fa\u6094\u8e0f\u3080 (#' + matches[1] + ')',-fr: 'Absorbez cette zone au sol (#' + matches[1] + ')',-ko: '\ucc38\ud68c \ubc1f\uae30 (#' + matches[1] + ')',-cn: '\u8e29\u6c34\u5708 (#' + matches[1] + ')',-};+return 'soakPuddle'; } }, infoText: function(data, matches) { if (matches[1] == data.puddle) return;-return {-en: 'Puddle #' + matches[1],-de: 'Fl\u00e4che #' + matches[1],-ja: '\u61fa\u6094 #' + matches[1],-fr: 'Zone au sol #' + matches[1],-ko: '\ucc38\ud68c #' + matches[1],-cn: '\u6c34\u5708 #' + matches[1],-};+return 'puddleNumber'; }, tts: function(data, matches) {-if (matches[1] == data.puddle) {-return {-en: 'Soak This Puddle',-de: 'Fl\u00e4che nehmen',-fr: 'Absorbez cette zone au sol',-ja: '\u6cbc\u8e0f\u3093\u3067',-ko: '\uc6c5\ub369\uc774 \ubc1f\uae30',-cn: '\u8e29\u6c34\u5708',-};-}+if (matches[1] == data.puddle)+return 'soakPuddleTTS';+},+outputStrings: {+soakPuddle: {+en: 'Soak This Puddle (#${matches[1]})',+de: 'Fl\u00e4che nehmen (#${matches[1]})',+ja: '\u61fa\u6094\u8e0f\u3080 (#${matches[1]})',+fr: 'Absorbez cette zone au sol (#${matches[1]})',+ko: '\ucc38\ud68c \ubc1f\uae30 (#${matches[1]})',+cn: '\u8e29\u6c34\u5708 (#${matches[1]})',+},+puddleNumber: {+en: 'Puddle #${matches[1]}',+de: 'Fl\u00e4che #${matches[1]}',+ja: '\u61fa\u6094 #${matches[1]}',+fr: 'Zone au sol #${matches[1]}',+ko: '\ucc38\ud68c #${matches[1]}',+cn: '\u6c34\u5708 #${matches[1]}',+},+soakPuddleTTS: {+en: 'Soak This Puddle',+de: 'Fl\u00e4che nehmen',+fr: 'Absorbez cette zone au sol',+ja: '\u6cbc\u8e0f\u3093\u3067',+ko: '\uc6c5\ub369\uc774 \ubc1f\uae30',+cn: '\u8e29\u6c34\u5708',+}, }, },The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

I could also imagine making the output strings functions? Like data.output.soakPuddle({puddle: matches[1]});.I think data and matches could always be implicitly available to this function as well so we don't have to write that everywhere.At any rate, I think an explicit approach like this would keep the javascript logic where it already is inside the triggers and then provide an explicit way to pass variables by name to the replacement function.

Tried in both Safari and Chrome and even the initial page where you choose the character is just blank.All iOS browsers use webkit behind the scenes, even Chrome or Firefox.cactbot raidboss uses lookbehind in regexes.Chromium (which is what OverlayPlugin uses via CEF) has supported this since 2017. Firefox has supported this since 2020.webkit (and therefore iOS in general, regardless of what browser frontend you use) will finally support this feature in its next release I assume, since it's listed as supported in the current Technology Preview release. No clue when that release will actually happen.https://caniuse.com/js-regexp-lookbehind "

I'm not really tied to the idea there and if it turns out shields aren't easily available right now, that's fine too.I get that raidemulator has a bunch of log loading and parsing built in, but other than that, I think the \"replayer\" vs \"emulator\" use cases are very distinct from each other.

That tool would be a bit faster but not significantly, since most of the slowdown right now is in running the log lines through PopupText 8 times (once for each player).There are some potential performance gains there by flagging lines that actually match trigger regexes on the first player's analysis and only processing those lines on future analysis but then there's potential for delayed triggers and such to drift, so making that code faster would be a bit complex.Realistically, for any alternative tool, all you really need to do is something like:const options = {}; // Pull raidboss options as normalconst log = ''; // full log read in from somewhereconst logLines = log.split(/\\r?\\n/gm);const encDay = ''; // figure out from lines or use a dummy valueconst encZoneId = ''; // figure out from lines or use a dummy valueconst encZoneName = ''; // figure out from lines or use a dummy valueconst enc = new Encounter(encDay, encZoneId, encZoneName, logLines);enc.initialize();// AnalyzedEncounter only needs emulator for one thing, can be refactoredconst emulator = new RaidEmulator(options);const analyzedEnc = new AnalyzedEncounter(options, enc, emulator);await analyzedEnc.analyze();// At this point you can access analyzedEnc.perspectives to get executed trigger data "

That tool would be a bit faster but not significantly, since most of the slowdown right now is in running the log lines through PopupText 8 times (once for each player).Unrelatedly, maybe we shouldn't do that? If that's the biggest slowdown, then maybe we should skip that feature so that everything loads more quickly.On a similar note, I know you've optimized Data copying because it's slow, and I don't know that I use that either.Would it be speed things up to not store it?

However, I'm not sure how exactly workers would pan out with any sort of command-line node execution.There's additional performance gains that could be gotten by adding the same sort of logic that's in the parser plugin now for self/party/alliance as a config setting, but we'll have to carry forward the 0x02 (player change) and 0x0B (party change) lines for that to be viable.

Now though, my raidboss.js file is getting slightly out of hand. I was wondering if there is a method to split the raidboss file by some command like \"import(./raidboss-e2s.js)\" for example. I'm not too familiar with JS, but a quick Google search led me to believe that I don't know the correct terms to search for... I would very much like to have all customisation available at a time, even though, of course, we're not doing all tiers in a night. Just for the sake of convenience and to allow for a spontaneous choice of fight, without having to change the user files.Thank you for your time, especially all the time you have put into making this plugin work. I'm still amazed :)Yours faithfully,Gust LeonardPS: I would have sent you a PM, but I don't know how... Hence this might not read as a typical 'issue', as you may have noticed.

(e.g. small aos, big aoe, line aoe, donut aoe)I don't see any \"small aoe\" anywhere.I think \"big aoe\" could be a separate item if you wanted it to be, but I think it's pretty uncommon.Donut could be its own item, although usually when there's a donut it says \"get in\".Do you have examples of donut callouts?\"line aoe\" sounds like something on the floor, and I'm generally opposed to triggers that just say \"avoid things on the floor you can see\", so maybe just remove those triggers.We have .silence() but shouldn't this be changed to .interupt() due to game changes? if not we would need stun/interuptI guess technically it's now \"interrupt\" and not silence, that's fair.Maybe it'd be good to change everything to that.I do think there are things that need to be stunned and can't be interrupted, and those should continue to say stun.Whats the difference between .killAdds() and .killExtraAdd()?I think killAdds is like \"here are adds that happen normally, make sure they die\" and \"killExtraAdd\" is like \"whoops somebody messed up on Titania and there's an unexpected add here?\"How do we deal with add anouncments when there are specific names e.g. Bennu add in t12 or dreadnaught add in t8? (maybe use .killExtraAdd(\"Name\") for specific and .killAdds() just as a generall announcement)Yeah, I think they should take a name, and ideally that name should come from the line that is matched so that it doesn't need to be translated.How do we deal with add/skill specific silences? (t8 = blue golem, t7(and others) = ram's/dragon's voice)We might need silenceMob(mob) and silenceSkill(skill)? I'm not sure if the grammar ends up being different on those.Whats the difference between .getUnder() and .getIn()Under is like \"be in the hitbox\" and in is more like \"get close but maybe even melee range is fine\".Whats the difference between .awayFromFront() and .outOfFront()I think these are the same.Whats the difference between .outOfMelee() and .getOut()Maybe a degree of difference? \"Out of melee\" is \"get out a little bit\" \"get out\" is like \"get out a lot\".sleep()Sounds good, maybe with a target?.stackMiddle() or .stackTogether() (maybe with a parameter e.g. .stack(\"middle\"))I think \"stack together\" is the same as \"stack\".stackMiddle could be a separate response..spreadThanStack().stackThanSpread().charge() or .chargeAt() or .chargeOn()These seem reasonable..moveClockwise().moveCounterClockwise()Does this happen anywhere but Innocence?.goAwayFrom()Where does this happen?.breakChains().moveChainsTogether().earthshacker()These seem reasonable..knockbackFrom()Does this happen other than Dun Scaith? Maybe o9s?.hideBehind(\"target\")I'd say no on this one, as \"target\" will almost always need to be translated manually, so probably shouldn't live in responses.I would also suggest mechanicOnYou(\"mechanic\") "

That might require splitting the \"what is the zone name\" logic from \"is this a valid instance\" check, but should work.This wouldn't be guaranteed to catch the entirety of the first encounter after opening ACT, since the logs you attached seem to send that line after engaging. However, that's still far better than the current situation.I think we should keep the current \"[INSTANCE] has begun\" check as an automatically-correct \"is this an instance\" check, since when it fires it's guaranteed to be right.

One of the reasons I use raidemulator is for data collection/analysis of certain mechanics with user triggers, so it is important for me to find pulls that reached a certain point (phase). Loading long encounters seems to take at least a few seconds in DSR, so I want to minimize how many unnecessary checks I do to get the actual duration of the pull. Because the \"duration\" field in the UI doesn't consider offset, it is basically impossible to see the length of a pull without at least clicking on the encounter row and doing some mental math to manually subtract the offset. Alternatively, I could just upload the log to fflogs to see the start time of all the relevant pulls, but this is more hoops than I feel should be necessary.I didn't include it in my image above, but if the current behavior is important, then another idea would be to add another field/line for Pull Duration. I am not familiar enough with how others use raidemulator to understand the need to know the duration that is currently displayed instead of subtracting offset first.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

The magic stones seem to spawn with an x/y offset from center of 7.5/1.0 (or 1.0/7.5, depending on which wall they are attached to).The two poison stones seem to spawn with an offset of 4.0/4.0 from the corner (e.g. 89,89, 89,111, etc.) or from center (e.g. 96,96, 96,104, etc.).So we can check if any quadrant is empty (if so, that's safe) -- and if not, we pick the quadrant with a stone closest to center, knowing that's the poison stone.Will play around and do some testing (hopefully today), but curious if anyone has seen a better way to figure out which stones are magic vs. poison.

Or we could turn them into helper functions on data rather than calculating them every time.The reason this is an issue is that Regexes and oopsy events use different names and worse, it's possible to use a regex: Regexes.headMarker() (for example) as an oopsy regex and then instead of saying e.targetName you have to remember to say matches.target.See: f3cc650It would be better to:remove events entirely and make oopsy functions take [data, matches] as parametersreturn all the special information that oopsy wants in matches by using (Net)Regexesif there's any additional oopsy-specific information, make helper functions on dataconvert gainsEffectRegex/losesEffectRegex into NetRegexes.gainsEffectalso use effect ids to avoid translationsconvert abilityRegex into NetRegexes.abilityFullconsider removing damageRegex / healRegex and converting to NetRegexes.abilityFullat the very least, these should be NetRegexes.abilityFull in terms of the matches they return even if they have more conditions on how they matchcc @JLGarberThe text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

That's the single biggest pain point for me when I'm putting oopsy packages together.I think it might be nice to retain damageRegex/healRegex as a convenient shorthand rather than having to write out the NetRegexes line in full.

Now, the TTS not only speaks my doom number, but also \"Cleanse 1 Player Name\" \"Cleanse 2 Player Name\" \"Cleanse 3 Player Name\". This chatter can get rapid and overlay one another. This also happens with Hatch Triggers, and Divebomb mark positions (all of which are lowest priority).I'm not sure what changed between versions that would cause this.

However, when accessing data.triggerSetConfig in the code, it returns an empty string '' instead of the default value.The input box in the config panel should have gray font color to indicate that the triggerSetConfig value is unmodified when it is the same as the default value.This is highly misleading to users because they see a value displayed, but in reality, it is an empty string. Moreover, this behavior contradicts the behavior of outputStrings, so I believe it is a bug. (outputStrings correctly retrieves the default value, and the value saved in the JSON is also an empty string, which is consistent with the expected behavior.)I believe these two issues share a commonality, which is why I have reported them together.Reproducejs:Options.Triggers.push({zoneId: ZoneId.MatchAll,id: \"Souma_Test\",config: [{ id: \"TEST_20230707\", name: { en: \"TEST_20230707\" }, type: \"string\", default: \"Hello\" }],triggers: [{id: \"TEST 20230707\",type: \"StartsUsing\",netRegex: { capture: false },infoText: (_data, _matches, output) => output.text(),suppressSeconds: 9999,run: (data, _matches, output) => {console.warn(\"config:\", data.triggerSetConfig.TEST_20230707);console.warn(\"output:\", output.text());},outputStrings: { text: { en: \"World\" } },},],});config:raidemulator:Clear config string and restart ACT:raidemulator:The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

The dogs then shuffle around. When they're done shuffling, a room-wide attack takes place with only a small safe spot next to the previously-tethered dog.The instruction doesn't really help, since it gives no actual information about the coming attack or how to dodge it. I watch the tethered dog jump around... but then what? Then suddenly an AoE appears under my feet and I take damage with no time to get out of the way. It's a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things, but generally Cactbot's instructions are more clear and helpful. This one stands out to be as being confusing and not really helpful.If the instruction were simply changed to something like \"Watch tethered dog and then stand near it\" it would be a lot more clear.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: \ud83d\udc4d1 quisquous reacted with thumbs up emoji \ud83d\udc4d1 reaction"

Additionally, based on these videos the boss doesn't use strict north/south but instead appear to use various sections of the arena.At a minimum, the callouts will likely need to be \"move between Hansel and Gretel\" and \"move opposite of Hansel and Gretel\", rather than just north/south.I am unsure how to fix the detection of which side each boss is on.Additional informationI've attached a log file for the Hansel and Gretel fight.

Subsequently, I delay their output by 6.5, 10, and 13.5 seconds, respectively. However, to achieve this, I must create four separate triggers.Before creating a new trigger, I might suggest looking at the Gale Spheres trigger that's already in place for the Golbez Normal raid, as it already handles that mechanic.https://github.com/quisquous/cactbot/blob/main/ui/raidboss/data/06-ew/trial/golbez.tsIt's been a minute, but iirc, I think I shamelessly copied the logic for that trigger from valarnin's original (still WIP) PR #5425 for Golbez Ex.Regardless, I would suggest keeping the same trigger logic that's used for Golbez normal for GolbezEx unless there's a reason to deviate (and iirc, I don't think there is).But as to the code in your PR: it's hard to tell without seeing the full code, but I'm not sure I see a need to do four separate triggers, since I think your regex for each trigger looks(?) identical.It should just be a matter of capturing each cast and sticking the directional info sequentially in data.[whatever] (if that's even necessary).The issue that arises is that I don't need to receive the required text in the output for the next three outputs; instead, it is obtained in the output of the first trigger and then saved in data for use in the subsequent three triggers. However, this violates the 'no outputStrings in trigger' rule.EDIT: Sorry, I was speed-reading and missed the issue.If you're writing your own triggers, you can return a string directly from infoText, but if you are planning to PR the trigger, lint will alert if you try to return a string; I believe the requirement is to use outputStrings indirection so that the content of the string can be changed for each trigger in the UI.(It's mentioned in https://github.com/quisquous/cactbot/blob/main/docs/RaidbossGuide.md)Hope that helps!

There's still a lot for me to learn, so for now, I'm just asking about this particular rule.If needed, my complete code is hereThe reason I divided it into four parts is that it would be very confusing if the text was read all at once. So, I designed it to display all safe zone texts first, and the TTS (Text-to-Speech) announces the next safe zone after each judgment. Personally, I believe this is more \"disability-friendly,\" so I did it this way. I think I need to use infoText, and I don't need outputString.So, maybe I can \"ignore\" this issue since I'm only creating it for personal triggers?

There's no way to know in the cactbot config ui that to modify the output of trigger B that you should find trigger A and modify it instead.It's not a perfect solution and it makes things awkward in situations like this where you have one trigger with all the logic and several other triggers to call things out. Even if you do things like endsinger-ex's const orbOutputStrings and just outputStrings: orbOutputStrings for each trigger, it still does mean that users have to fill in each of them redundantly.I think there is probably a use case for \"trigger set output strings\", where the triggerset itself has some shared set of output strings that users can fill in once and that apply everywhere. I think I'd still maybe want cactbot developers to fill in which outputstrings are used so we could display that in the UI though? Alternatively, maybe some way of grouping triggers together that say \"hey all of these four triggers use this set of outputstrings\", but the ui for that is less clear. \ud83d\udc4d1 Souma-Sumire reacted with thumbs up emoji \ud83d\udc4d1 reaction"

Since the name for the Hunt mobs are taken from the game files directly with a python script that generates the hunts.js file where the names are found my fix will be overwritten once someone starts that script.Now usually parsing stuff from the game files is fine. However since german language is a b*tch, we do have all sorts of special cases for genders and what not. So in the game files \"Letzte Flamme Dalvags\" is noted as \"Letzt[a] Flamme[p] Dalvags\"Now I already know that [p] stands for plural and adds whatever letter(s) needs to be added to denote the plural version (in case of those names they are usually just removed as there is no plural).[a] as in article (= Geschlechtswort) for gender based endings: Most of them are \"e\" (female) or \"er\" (male) depending on the gender of the name described by it.There's also [t] which is the title (= Anrede) used, usually also denoted by the gender of whatever word/name it describes.Example: Sanu Vali [t] Tanzend[a] Schwinge would be \"Sanu Vali die Tanzende Schwinge\"In this case [t] would be \"die\" because \"Schwinge\" is female and [a] would be \"e\" also because of Schwinge being of female origin.Now I don't know if the missing letters can be pulles from the game files aswell, which is why I did not modify the python-script generating the hunts.js, but instead opted for altering the actual file even though it says not to.I did not look too much into the radar.js, but if those names are used for regular expressions I assume one could come up with regexp-strings for replacement of each of those [*] tags.[p] could be removed[t] would be /d(?>er|ie|as)/[a] would be /er?/So \"Sanu Vali [t] Tanzend[a] Schwinge\" would become \"Sanu Vali d(?>er|ie|as) Tanzender? Schwinge\" which would indeed match \"Sanu Vali die Tanzende Schwinge\".\"Letzt[a] Flamme[p] Dalvags\" would be \"Letzter? Flamme Dalvags\" and would also match for \"Letzte Flamme Dalvags\".Hope this helps to come up with something better than my pull request. "

The Pronoun field is either 0 (= der), 1 (= die) or 2 (= das).[p] can be removed in all cases, even for plural.For some reason the [p] is also present in ALL plural version of names (items and mobs) that are in the game data. e.g.Singular: Letzt[a] Flamme[p] DalvagsPlural: Letzt[a] Flammen[p] DalvagsFlammen is already plural, only in this case [a] would be en and not e.

I have a feeling that it might be related to Chrome's security settings that by default prevent access to locally hosted files.There are several workarounds available on the web, but this one is worth a shot:http://www.chrome-allow-file-access-from-file.com/windows.htmlOf course it depends on the users locally installed version of Chrome. I'm not entirely sure how chrome is launched or instantiated via ACT and this Overlay Plugin, but adding --allow-file-access-from-files as a flag to launching the browser like this PATH_TO_CHROME_INSTALLATION\\chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files might work.I believe the issue is with the code attempting to directly access a local file with an explicit path. Other's have suggested using a local web server to call the assets from as well, using a plugin like: Web Server for Chrome .Hope this helps. It might require some digging and trial and error.Edit: Please note that this restriction is a security measure that's in place for a reason, so for testing and short term purposes, isolated to ACT plugin development (or whatever you might be tinkering with, it's fine, but I wouldn't recommend running around the web with this disabled).

See the guides here:https://github.com/quisquous/cactbot/blob/main/docs/TimelineGuide.mdhttps://github.com/quisquous/cactbot/blob/main/docs/RaidbossGuide.mdNote that you may need to use npx ts-node ... instead of just ts-node ... for the helper tools for timeline creation, if you don't have npx installed globally.RaidEmulator can be used to test triggers and such without having to go through the content again, it works fine for every trigger except getCombatants-based triggers (Fixes for that soon\u2122). To use raidemulator, run the webpack dev server with npm run start, then connect to it via http://localhost:8080/ui/raidboss/raidemulator.html. Finally, drag and drop an ACT FFXIVLogs/Network*** log file onto the page to import it, and load it using the pane at the bottom. \ud83d\udc4d1 foophoof reacted with thumbs up emoji \u2764\ufe0f1 foophoof reacted with heart emoji \ud83d\udc4d1 reaction\u2764\ufe0f1 reaction"

In the case of Stigma-4, it is particularly problematic because the callout activates at the same time as Mindjack stuns the player, which would render newer players unable to react at all.In the case of the second extreme trial, this might be more personal, but I tend to prefer to rely on aural cues - however, the cactbot callout is so late that an aural cue tied to it ends up being useless and I must rely on the visual cue to react in time.Would it be possible to improve the response time of these callouts to make them more useful?Thank you.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

I've used cactbot in previous expansions and in previous ex fights, such as weapon, I haven't noticed the issue before, and that's why this seemed odd to me.For EX2, it was consistently behind the visual telegraph for me - I gave up on trying to use cactbot's aural cue.For Stigma-4...

I just used default settings for everything before, didn't customize anything about user data storage, so I don't have any particular knowledge about where I should start looking.

Maybe I'm overthinking it, but we want to avoid these kinds of blockers as much as possible given the expansion release coming up.Building on that, instead of having people ever manually edit the resource file, we can create it one-time and then have a workflow that runs only on merge commits to main that looks for new trigger types and, if one is found, adds it to the resource file (well, I suppose, opens a PR to add it to the resource file, so we don't have a workflow merging unreviewed commits directly).That would solve the need for anyone to actively keep the resource file in sync.If we wanted to do unit tests on top of that, we can create a unit test script and hook it to mocha.It would automatically run against the auto-created PR to tell us if there's an issue with the changed resource file before it gets merged.

If it happens to any of us who contribute regularly, it shouldn't be much of a burden to jump over and approve the auto-generated PR.The way I'm envisioning it, I think we could even remove the blocking element.So the flow would be something like:used_log_types resource file contains all currently used logline types.It gets imported/used by splitter.ts at the time someone splits a log with the analysis flag/checkbox turned on.It's also read by a mocha test to determine which line types to unit test against the splitter function.Any contributor opens a PR with a trigger that uses a new log type.(The mocha test workflow continues to run fine, since nothing new has been added to used_log_types yet.)The PR with triggers is approved & merged.The merging of the PR fires an update_usedlogtypes workflow that runs a script to check all log types currently in use in the repo, and updates used_log_types if any new ones are found.If that results in changes to used_log_types, the workflow will create a new branch, commit the changed used_log_types file, and open a PR against the new branch.(Note: This step can be handled entirely by an existing GH action like this one.The PR being opened will -- as normal with PRs -- trigger the test workflow that runs mocha.It automatically runs against the PR head branch, so the updated used_log_types file will be used.If the update results in a failed unit test, it'll get flagged on the PR; if not, the PR can be merged at any point (it won't block anything in the meantime).Takes a lot of words to write out, but I think it's pretty clean, implementation-wise? \ud83d\udc4d1 JLGarber reacted with thumbs up emoji \ud83d\udc4d1 reaction"

Timelines use raw act log lines, but they're all faiiiirly normalized and we could...convert them magically into network log lines, and use tests to verify that they can be converted as such. Most other things use regex helpers, which could be converted to network log lines too.This would also solve the zone id issue and effect id issues (to avoid translations on both of them), would provide positioning information on more lines, and some other good stuff.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

It's a guarantee that it will double processing time, and that's only going to get worse as the plugin gets older. That being said, FabulousCupcake is right that we should get some hard numbers on it. Didn't panicstevenson do some benchmarking for us when we moved regexes to global case insensitivity? Maybe we could bribe persuade them to whip something up for us here too?Honestly, I don't think it's too risky to switch to network lines. Just about all the timelines use 15 lines for everything, so in theory automatic conversion there should Just Work. I know there are a few here and there that use other lines (Fractal Continuum comes to mind) but the majority should be fine. "

There are cases where it's more minor than full splits, though, that it's useful, and it doesn't necessarily have to break compatibility.Take O7S for example; We can figure out whether an upcoming cast will be Load or Skip or Retrieve based on prior activity. In the timeline itself we can simply have \"Load??\" like is in there now, and kaizoban will happily eat it up just like that. But with triggers, if we see a skip, we can look for the next \"Load??\" cast and replace it with \"Skip\", and if we don't, then we can replace the next \"Load??\" cast with simply \"Load\". This is even more applicable to O7N where we know that a given Load will be one of two things, but not which one until it goes off. The timeline resorts to just a plain \"Load\" there because everything preceding it is the same and it's totally not worth it to map out every pair just to hang onto the implicit variable of what the current and prior programs were.Doing the selection based on current timeline position and actual ability names might not be the best way to go about it, but it is certainly possible to handle entirely within the triggers part, assuming you have a way of scanning timeline entries and getting the current time (these may not be true, I haven't looked at the core js parts too closely).If it's something that happens more often throughout the fight, maybe you can set up a hideall \"--sync2--\" line, add an instance of that before the one we want (or even at the same time) that doesn't actually sync with anything, and use that as the starting time for the entry search to replace. Or even just require unique ones altogether if they're going to be replaced, then add hideall \"A/B\" and add \"{time} A\" if we see B first. Or, even less intrusive, if you don't mind coupling timelines and triggers a little more tightly, just straight up use the timeline number itself to select lines. "

C:/Users/Trim21/proj/cactbot/node_modules/webpack/node_modules/schema-utilsCurrently (after the patch of new trigger style), the slowness of popup-text.ts file is beacuse when getting or setting a property of trigger (like trigger.id), it need to narrow the type of trigger (here it's BaseTrigger<RaidbossData, \"GameLog\"> & PartialNetRegexTrigger<\"GameLog\"> & Partial<BaseTrigger<RaidbossData, \"None\"> & PartialRegexTrigger & PartialNetRegexTrigger<...>>) | ... 39 more ... | (BaseTrigger<...> & ... 2 more ...) to anyone of them, and it's really slow (tsc even can't show the full list!).And it's not hard to solve, we create a new variable const processed: ProcessedTrigger = {} and copy all fields, and set property to this new processed trigger, and orderedTriggers.push(processed);roughly

(rejection id: 2)So it turns out that ESLint (or nodejs, precisely) didn't know the new syntax of ES2020.Then I found that ESLint in VSCode was called by the VSCode built-in Node.js environment, whose version is 12.18.3 now.My VSCode EnvironmentVersion: 1.55.1 (user setup)Commit: 08a217c4d27a02a5bcde898fd7981bda5b49391bDate: 2021-04-07T15:06:02.360ZElectron: 11.3.0Chrome: 87.0.4280.141Node.js: 12.18.3V8: 8.7.220.31-electron.0OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.19041Fortunately, there is an option in the ESLint extension of VSCode to specify the runtime library that VSCode called (i.e. the built-in Node.js or the external ones that user installed), but to enable this option, user still have to manually select the current runtime in the GUI.Here is the description of this option (eslint.runtime):The location of the node binary to run ESLint under.When specified as a user/machine setting, the Node version from eslint.runtime automatically replaces the built-in version.When specified as a workspace setting, eslint.runtime allows you to switch to use that version with the ESLint: Select Node version command.SolutionSolution 1To change the syntax of the cactbot-output-strings.js, not to use the brand new syntax, so that VSCode would be happy with the elder syntax.(There are only 2 place that use the new syntax, so I think it is not difficult to make the change)Solution 2Let user change the eslint.runtime option in their own machine, this bug would also be solved. So that we don't need to change any code of cactbot.(But personally, I don't like this solution, for example, I have both Linux and Windows to develop cactbot, I would be tired to switch between different runtime paths if goes this way.)FYI, cc @trim21 @panicstevensonThe text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

I changed a few settings within GitHub Desktop, but those didn't affect anything either. Essentially, I didn't want any fix that was still going to impact the next user and they would have to figure it out or find this issue or give up. Ultimately the change would have to be that husky invoking lint-staged directly wouldn't work and that it had to be hoisted up to npm where something would know about the environment necessary. npm run lint-staged doesn't work, since that would be a user-defined script that we don't have. However, npx lint-staged does work. At least, it does for me, on all of my (now three) setups.Before opening a PR and calling this fixed for a workflow that I don't use, I'd like to invite you both to changing the following code snippet within package.json:\"husky\": {\"hooks\": {\"pre-commit\": \"lint-staged\"}},to:\"husky\": {\"hooks\": {\"pre-commit\": \"npx lint-staged\"}},And see if that fixes your issues.

Normally Promise.resolve returns the original object if it's instanceof Promise. DexiePromise.resolve does the same but only for DexiePromise objects. Triggers with delays get an extra constructed delay promise that wraps everything else and so skip this issue. I ran a normal log through this and see plenty of StartsUsing trigger errors as well, so there isn't anything special there.If I breakpoint the Promise.resolve(promise) line in popup-text.js, it seems to be fine while going through different character perspectives (I see a lot of Loading id souma_test in the console) and then at some point the Promise global object gets overwritten. It's unclear to me when this happens as dexie.mjs seems to run that code immediately. It seems like really bad form to overwrite the global Promise object but it looks like even current versions of Dexie still use this due to IndexedDB promise incompatibility.One nice thing about checking for Promise exactly is that we know that both it thennable but also that it is asynchronous. It would be nice to have stronger guarantees about which functions created asynchronicity vs were always synchronous when looking at a cactbot trigger. Unfortunately, there's no way to guarantee that a function is asynchronous without running it and checking that it returns a promise, but promises themselves are guaranteed to be asynchronous.I guess I see a couple of options:explicitly check for instanceof DexiePromise as well (like the commit mentioned in the description)just check that the value of a trigger promise field has a then function and live with (unlikely but possibly) synchronous trigger promise fields?(cc @valarnin) "

For instance, in Ultima';s Bane, Ifrit EX, and Ultima Ultimate, Eruption happens multiple times in a short window and can't be synced. Currently, we just manually comment out the sync portion, while leaving the timestamp and text, but it would be nice if the script would do this for us automagically.A thing we could try is to build an object with each ability ID as a key, and each timeline occurrence of that ID in an array as a value. Then, during the timeline string assembly step, we could do a check for \"are there any other uses of this ability close to this timestamp?\". I'm envisioning it looking something like this:const extractTLEntriesFromLog = (lines: string[],targetArray: string[] | null,): { entries: TimelineEntry[]; abilityMap: { [abilityId: string]: number[] }} => {const entries: TimelineEntry[] = [];const abilityMap: { [abilityId: string]: number[] } ={};for (const line of lines) {// build entry and push to entries abilityMap[lineAbilityId] ??= [];abilityMap[lineAbilityId].push(lineAbilityTimelineTimestamp);}return { entries: entries; abilityMap: abilityMap };};And then during the string assembly loop, we can compare each occurrence of an ability with all others, and see whether any are too close. I'm not completely sure of the implementation details yet, but I think this is the only way to ensure that the first occurrence of a string of too-close abilities gets synced.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: \ud83d\udc4d1 quisquous reacted with thumbs up emoji \ud83d\udc4d1 reaction"

But the game doesn't explicitly tell us that so-and-so doesn't have a stack. The brute-force solution that springs to mind is to prepare an array of party member names, and then warn if anyone in that array doesn't have a stack. (Fortunately the Timbeeeeer cast resolves before the tethers, so it's at least possible to collect names there there if nothing else.) Is there a better way to handle this than to gather names on that first AoE? It will work, but it feels messy. "

While probably not necessary, init() waits for information to be propagated up, such as language.While probably still not a large body of work, it was more than I was expecting when initially looking into this, assuming that test timeline bars just needed to be added to the raidboss.html.

                "content": "I recently started using cactbot's raidboss plugin for FFXIV. I have been using ACT, with the Kagerou overlay, for some time now and decided to look into more ACT plugins. Raidboss worked perfectly for about 2 days until I got into a Titania EX party (don't know if that is related) and everything but the general alerts (those for living dead, shirk, holmgang, etc.) stopped working. So I left the Titania EX party, tested the plugin using the dummy in middle la noscea (which worked fine) and re-entered Titania EX, and ran it multiple times, only to have cactbot cease functioning again at what seemed to be random points early in her fight (working for 2-4mins then stopping (save the general alerts)). I have tried a fresh install of ACT, Kagerou, and cactbot to no apparent success. Restarting ACT itself (or reloading the raidboss overlay) has no apparent effect on it randomly stopping either.After shutting down my computer last night and logging into FFIXIV, cactbot worked perfectly for Titania EX and other dungeons throughout the evening but stopped functioning when I entered Crown of the Immaculate EX (except for the general alerts. again, not sure if the EX trial itself is relevant).When it randomly stops and starts working, I am not doing anything with ACT besides showing/hiding the Kagerou overlay (both it and ACT retain full functionality). I do have moderate experience with coding, but cannot seem to find anything wrong in the code itself (doesn't mean there isn't, just that my hypotheses for why the cactbot plugin was losing most of its functionality were wrong). I am also receiving no error messages from ACT, kagerou or cactbot.I would greatly appreciate any insight as to why this may be happening. This plugin is awesome and would make savage content so much simpler for me if I could get it to function properly on a consistent basis.Thanks in advanced for any help!The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: "

If you turn on Show developer options and Enable debug mode (for raidboss) do you see Loading id test 20230507?Sorry that I did not write documentation about this yet.There is no getter function.This is the best explanation that exists in the code: https://github.com/quisquous/cactbot/blob/main/resources/user_config.ts#L69-L78The data flow here is this:evaluate the default as the starting value (either a direct value or a function)this default value is shown in the config ui if a value hasn't been setany overrides from the config ui are stored in the OverlayPlugin json filewhen loading an overlay (e.g. raidboss, but also config), the OverlayPlugin json file is loaded and any values in there will override the default valuethese values are stored on Options by id (for most options) or in data.triggerSetConfig for trigger set optionsfor other overlays, setterFunc can also be applied to turn one option into multiple options or to do a data conversion or something like that, but probably isn't necessary most of the timesetterFunc is not run for config, as config does not need to use the result of Options or data.triggerSetConfig.It only cares about default and saving/loading values froom the OverlayPlugin json file.

For example, if I need the user to provide a string that meets certain formatting requirements, if I can use the setterFunc in the config UI, I can immediately validate the user's input. If the format does not meet the requirements, I can inform the user immediately and revert it to the default value. If I cannot use the setterFunc, the user would save a string in the JSON file that cannot be properly used at runtime, and the config UI would only display that string. Only when the actual trigger is executed and fails the validation, would it use the default value or show an error.In my practice, I expose a large number (dozens) of different sorting rules for users to input as arrays in string format. I want them to be correctly separated by commas. Otherwise, it will revert to the default value after saving and refreshing, so that the user is aware of it. Without a way to perform checks, it would be difficult to detect minor input errors.Perhaps another new feature could be proposed to have a callback function for validating the legality of the config when it is a string.Just my personal opinion.

They're for e12s lions, calling out when and where to bait for line lions strat for my static.2. above as an example could be the statue baits, or e12s p2 relativity mechanics.If there's an equivalent of Observable in JS, a proposal to resolve these could be something like the following (could be split out into two separate properties if needed):{id: 'trigger 1',regex: /pattern/,chain: (data, matches, output, continueObservable, logLineObservable) => {logLineObservable.then((line) => {if (/someRegex/.matches(line))continueObservable.next();});window.setTimeout(() => {data.someVar = 1;continueObservable.next();}, 1000);window.setTimeout(() => {data.someVar = 2;continueObservable.next();}, 1000);window.setTimeout(() => {data.someVar = 3;continueObservable.next();}, 1000);},infoText: (data) => 'tips ' + data.someVar,}The accompanying changed code in PopupText would be relatively simple, functionally similar to the way promise is handled currently for the continueObservable property, and logLineObservable would need to be tracked and passed lines in some manner. The question mark with a setup like this is how to handle cleanup.Another option would be some sort of event listener setup (since that's functionally what Observable is under the hood).There are plenty of options, and I'm willing to code up whatever is decided on since it's useful for me, and send a PR for it.

These make the raid emulator so much more useful for me.I'll close this issue now that everything is addressed.We don't really have any other open issues for converting to typescript, mostly just because it's an ongoing project across many files.The eventual goal is \"turn everything javascript or python into typescript\".If you think there are details that need tracking, then feel free to file an issue.And yes, please do not convert to typescript all in one pass.The majority of typescript conversions so far have caused some bug or another, and so the more contained the patches can be the easier it is to review and catch issues at review time.My recommendation here is:convert a single file at once, make minimal changes other than satisfying typescriptI found it easier to start bottom up in terms of dependencies, so you can use the real types of things you've already converted than make up types for them ahead of timeone exception to \"a single file\" is simple files that require minimal/no changes (maybe some of the network_log_converter/ files fit into this category, but probably little else)if there's fixups that make sense to do separately, send a separate PR to do that (e.g. raidboss: Miscellaneous Timeline Refactoring\u00a0#2845 or radar: construct regexes once, and not once per log line\u00a0#2828)if a file is particularly huge and complicated, consider turning off typescript errors in comments and turning them on one PR at a time (I was thinking about doing this for popup-text.js, for example) "

Laying it out like this might be helpful to someone who doesn't know what hexadecimal is, but is able to see \"oh, that log line is 14 in ACT, and the guide says I should look for a 20 in the network log.\"Strong agree on auto-generating what we can. Quisquous, did we ever hear back from that one person who had new information on headmarker IDs (or maybe it was names)?

However, in the video below, I did not get such an alert text. (Note: I am overriding that trigger, however, that aspect of it should not be affected.)However, I believe I understand why this trigger is not working... I think data.tookThreeFireballs (the variable which drives the alert text) will never be populated because preRun() runs before delaySeconds().If I understand the fireball triggers correctly, because the target of the tether cannot (currently) be calculated, four triggers listen to an event near the beginning of the phase, and set a delay from there, one for each tether at a predetermined interval. Since, at the time of this initial event, zero fireballs have gone out, and since preRun() runs before delaySeconds(), I would therefore think that it is impossible for data.tookThreeFireballs to be populated at this time.(Log removed)That's all I got!

Other than that, all other triggers should be theoretically working.Everything else is based on abilities as they happen and so the timeline being incorrect should not affect them.I am not running this content anymore and am unlikely to ever run this again at this point.Sorry for taking so long to get around to fixing this, but I need as much as help as possible.It sounds like the issues are:timeline continues running (which might lead to incorrect \"pop eurekan potions\" + \"blackhole callouts\", but only these two)maybe some triggers are missing?
