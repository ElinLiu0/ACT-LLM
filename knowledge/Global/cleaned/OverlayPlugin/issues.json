OpenFilesDirectory - Opens the files directory for the given overlayType.b.

Given that there's already a forced location for RainbowMage.OverlayPlugin.config.json, it makes sense to me to enforce a subdirectory structure per overlay handler call.Mmmm, per-overlay directories doesn't entirely work with the existing cactbot structure, in that it loads everything out of one user directory.Subdirectory support was added later and I suspect that most people are not using it.It'd force many users to rename their user/raidboss.js files, or put things into subdirectories for them to continue working.Not saying it's impossible to add this restriction, but it would cause a good deal of pain, I think.I think loading a single directory rooted in AppData is plausible, but many users dislike this for whatever reason (see various issues and discord complaints where people want to put stuff somewhere else).A compromise is to load from somewhere that is rooted in the same directory that the DLL is in.e.g. if the DLL is in C:\\somedir\\OverlayPlugin.dll then C:\\somedir\\someotherdir\\user\\ is valid.It could be custom-picked or we could just hardcode it relative to the plugin.In any case, this would also cause user pain, but we could probably log a warning and also add a \"please move your A directory to B directory instead\" warning at the top of the cactbot config page.There may be a need for one or both of the following as well:a. OpenFilesDirectory - Opens the files directory for the given overlayType. b. Have the LoadFiles return the determined path - Could leak Windows username though?I'm not sure how this is different than the above? Is this a version with less processing on the C# side?Regarding config:I think that either setup should be fine, but there's a question of \"what happens when someone is using three cactbot overlays, as far as config is concerned?\". Should it for instance share the Panel .NET object across the tabs? Should clicking over to that tab force a refresh of the config page itself in case configs have been changed elsewhere?I guess there's two different config ideas here.There's \"top level config shared among multiple overlays\" and also \"config for an individual overlay\".I could imagine various options:support both ideas: shared config gets its own tab (like cactbot config), multiple overlays that register the same shared config just merge together/get de-duped, and individual config panels show up on the overlay panel itself (cons: extra work, cactbot probably the only one with this \"problem\")only top level config: any overlay that registers a shared config gets its own panel like \"cactbot config\" now, multiple registrations of the same thing get de-duped, (cons: possibly lots of tabs??)only individual configs: any overlay that registers a config has it show up on its own overlay tab (cons: weird to have the same shared cactbot config show up on every overlay panel, and have to reload other overlays when this changes)EDIT: other options include creating a new tab for overlay configs, rather than inserting them into the same place as overlays themselves.Additionally, does it make sense to for instance move the cactbot config to native controls instead of having it rendered as html? e.g. should the original suggestion of a RegisterConfigPanel handler instead accept a tree of controls to display/config options?I don't know.I find native controls to be cumbersome to implement, but maybe I'm just less familiar.There's a lot of things that cactbot needs to do (e.g. trigger names, trigger info, translations, timeline loading) to set up the config page that it would have to pass to C# to have that do.I think it'd be easier for cactbot (and other overlays) to set up html controls since they're already in html/js land, rather than try to dynamically generate native controls.If you're talking about statically generating controls, then I think that's opposed to the idea of getting rid of plugin code (and I'm not sure it'd make sense to have OverlayPlugin include cactbot native controls).

I think you'd want to change that.The framerate limit defaults to 30 and can be increased to 60 if you want to. 60 is the max limit since Chrome can't render any more than that.

(I think that line has blurred a bit and maybe that's a conversation to have later on after seeing how this resolves and how future additional log lines and such pan out, but it's definitely not a conversation to have now.)However, counteracting that is that I believe that documentation shouldn't exist alongside code that it's not documenting.As such, I'm fine with either options 2 or 3.My concern with 2 is that it may pose an issue inviting someone to the org when all they'll be doing is editing guides.My concern with 3 is that it's likely that any org for documentation will also include all the members of this org, and I'm not sure if you can set up github permissions to say \"this org includes everyone from that org\".

Since the game ver in the config is the latest one, OP will not try to re-fetch opcodes or check resources/opcodes.jsonc.One solution could be to always check the local resources/opcodes.jsonc first, and if there's no opcode for the latest game ver, then check the user config. If there's no opcode for the user config, fetch it from github & save it to the user config. This way if we do make a mistake with the opcodes, a new OP release will resolve the issue. Alternatively, you could just always try to fetch it from github, but I don't like the idea of always making an external request due to load time.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: All reactions"

I also added full doc comment to it for future development.I made some modification to make it possible adding or removing listeners whenever you want without calling startOverlayEvents(). I've tested this well on my own private React.js overlay but I don't know whether I should send messages to the plugin like this.Ported API and modified functions:https://github.com/amzrk2/ffxiv-overlay-api/blob/master/src/api.js#L96-L125https://github.com/amzrk2/ffxiv-overlay-api/blob/master/src/main.js#L34-L43npm registry:https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffxiv-overlay-apiFinally, could I ask if you would like to be added as a collaborator to this repository?

                "content": "Hm... this is kind of goes against what I intended when I implemented common.js. The dev docs explicitly mention that you're not supposed to bundle common.min.js and instead load the one I host.Most importantly I consider stuff like window.__OverlayCallback an implementation detail that could change in the next OverlayPlugin release.The idea was that if I had to change that API, I could just add a check to common.min.js and use the old API if the script is loaded in an old OverlayPlugin version and the new API in the opposite case.That's still possible if people bundle common.js with their overlay but that would also means that each overlay would have to update before I could release the next OverlayPlugin version.Finally, I added startOverlayEvents() intentionally to avoid common issues with cached events.A few events are triggered immediately after you register a listener for them with OverlayPlugin. This includes events like ChangeZone and ChangePrimaryPlayer. The idea behind this is that when your overlay appears, the player might already exist and might already be in a zone. You probably don't want to wait until the player (or the zone) changes so instead OverlayPlugin immediately triggers the event with the current value. However, this means that only the first listener that is registered will receive this data which can be confusing if it isn't explained anywhere.If you register all event listeners before you call startOverlayEvents(), this is never a problem since all listeners are registered before a single event is processed.In practice, I've never had a reason to register more listeners once the page has been loaded. Just calling startOverlayEvents() in my load event listern worked well enough and you don't have to pass any events since it can detect the necessary events through the listener registration.TL;DR: This is a nice effort but I'm not entirely sure how useful it's going to be since bundling the file might cause your overlay to break in future OverlayPlugin versions.Sorry for the long answer. I think I tried to explain too hard why things are the way they are. ^^\" All reactions"

Right now I generate the URLs on the server because I don't want to implement the URL generator twice (once in JS and once in C#). However, the server doesn't know if you're opening the page through ngrok or not since ngrok sends the same Host: header that a local browser would send for http://127.0.0.1:10501. I can change this but that requires a rewrite of the WebSocket implementation first. I want to get rid of WebSocket-Sharp (the current implementation) due to some annoying issues but it's fairly low priority for now.Regarding the file:/// URLs: At least for the builtin overlays (target bars, enmity, etc.), OverlayPlugin already generates working file:/// URLs. If you're seeing %% characters, then the replacement fails somewhere (the preset URL uses %%/ as the placeholder for the local file path).The URLs are listed because they still work in OBS which is a common enough use for them as far as I'm aware.I can probably extend the URL generator to generate different URLs for overlays vs. WebSocket URLs.The text typo has been fixed.I should add some error messages if one of the two ports is blocked.

The broadcast handler raises a BroadcastMessage event each time it is called. You can pass a source and a message (msg). The source is intended to identify the source overlay to allow subscribers to filter out unknown messages.You could then replace the browser's native console.log function with one that forwards all log messages to the broadcast handler and subscribe to the BroadcastMessage event in the overlay that will display the log / error messages.I'd prefer this solution since OverlayPlugin's log can get fairly spammy in debug versions and it'd break the separation between overlays (overlays could see log messages from all enabled overlays). The broadcast method also works over WebSocket which OverlayPlugin itself couldn't support (since it obviously can't capture a remote browser's log).That said, I'm open to discuss this further.

In order to overcome this, it would need to return initial values upon subscribing like ChangeZone. Maps often make more sense than zones for things like triggers and timelines, since it lets you separate the triggers by individual boss fight for dungeons and such.Second: Something like EnmityTargetData and EnmityAggroList, that just informs you when any entity changes targets.

If you use the current cache implementation, you'd only get the most recently-placed marker.One workaround would be to track every marker on the OP side, and emit a single event that conveys all marker positions, but that's both more work on the OP side, and more work on the client side if you're only interested in initial positions + diffs thereafter.Other areas affected by this include:Player head markers (Line 29/NetworkTargetMarker, not the other kind)If I get around to the latter half of Feature request: Map change event and target change events\u00a0#40 , it would be a similar story - I'd ideally want to know every target when initially connecting, but only diffs thereafterThe text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: All reactions"

Still a little bit slower than EnmityTargetData, but this specific case is very slow (~half a second).When targeting oneself, the value is 0 (i.e. no target). It seems to make no differentiation between targeting yourself and targeting nothing.I'd like to use these instead of subscribing to the very spammy EnmityTargetData event, especially since being part of the log file makes it reproducible, but these issues make it less usable compared to EnmityTargetData. To be clear - these don't seem to be issues with any OP logic - the game itself is doing this.I'm wondering what the best solution for this is. I can see:Change LineCombatant to read from TargetMemory for the local PC specifically.Create a new line or event that represents changes in target that uses TargetMemory (it could also support focus target).The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: All reactions"

I'm not sure what exactly would be going on here. I'll have to investigate.Re: target values in general. There are ActorControlTarget categories for SetTarget and SetPlayerTarget which could be emitted. But ActorControlTarget -> SetTarget is kind of spammy, compared to other AC categories.CountACTarget Category%23903SetPlayerTarget0.05%253883SetTarget0.63%40176153Total Packets Scanned100%And for comparison, across the same amount of log data, 3255585 261 lines were emitted.I'm not aware of a focus target AC category, I think that's client-side only? But I'd need to double check raw packet data to confirm. And also unfortunately I don't think the current player has any inbound network packets for changing targets at all. So going purely based off of network data is unlikely.Re: EnmityTargetData. In what way is this spammy? Is it emitting events when there haven't been any changes maybe?

Theoretically, the delay should be the same, whether you're initially selecting a target, selecting a different target, or deselecting a target, but it really feels like the latter is a bit slower. It's definitely still within the 1000ms worst case. If anything, selecting a target seems to be unexpectedly fast.I think, given that I'd still want it to work out of combat, it would be better to just make something new based off of EnmityTargetMemory.As for the current EnmityTargetMemory event:Yes, it will output even if nothing has changedIf I just want target data, it's very overkill. I'm already getting the target's other information from LineCombatant, and I may not even care about changes to enmity itself. If all I'm after is just the player's target (for example, to make a target overlay, or show who is currently targeted on a party overlay), all I really need is the ID like in LineCombatant.EnmityTargetData currently looks like this (heavily abridged):{\"type\":\"EnmityTargetData\",\"Target\":{/* an entire combatant JSON for the dummy */},\"Focus\":null,\"Hover\":null,\"TargetOfTarget\":{/* an entire combatant JSON for myself */ },\"Entries\":[{\"ID\":12345,\"OwnerID\":0,\"Name\":\"Name Here\",\"Enmity\":100,\"isMe\":true,\"HateRate\":100,\"Job\":24}]}Even if it did become its own event/line that emits only on a change, I'd be a little worried about the hover target, as that could easily be a spamfest on its own.

But this version is in a whole bunch of places, and we'd need to make sure they agreed.I don't know.Just brainstorming here, but I think it'd be nice if somebody felt like we should have a release, they can just put up a PR, then it can just get merged, etc.Maybe I'm overthinking this.

To fix it I need to create events within repository to control order of execution with lock.Did repeated testing, actually the order of execution I was worrying about will never happen since C# events are implemented as collection of delegates, invoking event handlers will cause runtime loop through the collection and invoke event handler one by one.Because of the lock, when FFXIV_ACT_Plugin fires ProcessChanged event, it will get blocked when it sees the caching method; effectively making it wait for handler to subscribe then execute.Actually it does happen, it did not happen because when I'm paused on breakpoint, all other threads are paused, and events are not firing even though they are fired on another thread. When using Sleep(15000) in place of pausing on break point, race condition occurred as expected and game process is not detected. All reactions"

For one, it poops whenever you try to use window which is not available in a worker, and for another I'm not sure if whatever magi-globals the plugin puts in the window exist in the worker space.Websockets work great, though, so I managed to get it working by modifying the contents of common. It's not ideal since it relies on implementation details that could change so I wonder if we could get like a common.worker.js in dist (or some other way cooler solution)?To get it to work I had to:Change wsUrl to not come from the location and instead be a param of connectWsMake an onmessage handler to initiate connectWs from the main process (the main process sends the wsUrl)Delete the 'else' part of the websocket/local statement so it always tries to use websocket.Change anything that assigned to window.variable into a const variable = declarationSorry if this is weird, it's not really an issue, it's a feature request so feel free to close it if it doesn't fit your scope!

It would also be worthwhile if this could drive the maintainer cost down as well, since creating a release is not automatic. There's various possible options to take here, but to name some at a high level that could work well with the given ecosystem:Check remote GitHub for changes to opcodes.json in the backgroundHave GitHub actions cut a release and automatically push it when opcodes.json is updatedCreate an option for the end user to automatically consume updatesThe first solves both sides of the issue, but is then potentially downloading something without the end user's consent, which, given the size, content, and mechanism, is probably okay. The other two both don't individually solve both parts of the issue and would require some additional component to address the spirit of this issue.My personal take would be to opt for the last option presented above and then continue to work to remove pains from the maintainers' lifecycle since most people maintaining this project have other projects (in addition to their other commitments); however, that shouldn't be seen as a blocker since I believe effectively all of these options can be mixed and matched to come up with a workable solution.The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: All reactions"

                "content": "Replying to @xpdota from the other thread:Would having it automatically update when it sees that the game version is not found in the opcodes file work? I think the case that that doesn't handle is if someone gets the opcode wrong, pushes an update with it, but since that would be uncommon, you could just manually push a release with the fixed code.I think this would work well enough as well; it provides an optimization that would make checking GitHub less necessary (probably not necessary from GitHub's end, but definitely being a better user of the platform). I don't exactly know how opcodes work well enough to know how they work across the various locales, but, from how they look at a surface-level, this sounds sufficient enough to approach bringing down the number of checks.There's still an issue at the end of this where does OverlayPlugin simply use the values it found from GitHub or does it attempt to also write to disk (potentially overwriting opcodes.json or writing it somewhere as a temporary means until the next update)?I think there's pros and cons to each approach, but I don't think that making network calls is a very strong con, but it would mean that the next OverlayPlugin release does have to come \"eventually\" so that the plugin sees that it has the available opcode. Inversely, if OverlayPlugin downloads the new opcodes.json, theoretically the plugin could continue to work for long periods of time without an official release. The downside there obviously being that any failed update will be much harder to troubleshoot. All reactions"

I also had the initial thought in the same vein as valarnin in that \"can logs just be processed faster (or in parallel)?\" Although that skirts the true design issue here for the sake of a bandaid (albeit maybe effective enough).I think as far as the other things listed here -- I don't think any existing logs can really be removed without causing some detriment (if that were even an available option), which leads into the same situation on the other side once additional logs have been added -- they're hard to take away once added.As for some heuristic to what's okay to put in and what isn't, I really couldn't say. Likely you want things that cause triggers to be available within logs for the sake of debugging, changing, etc. (extending down to base ACT, as far as I'm concerned). We could say that MapEvents are okay and necessary given the evolution of fight mechanics, but comparing a modern fight to one from A Realm Reborn will have very different logging amounts for things like that, making it relatively difficult to gate what is and isn't okay based off volume, leaving us with (as far as I can see) two metrics: value added and accessibility.I consider the former to be the more obvious: How nice would it be to have a trigger? And the latter to be how nice it would be to have just that log line without supplemental logic. I don't know the full state of the third party ecosystem (I think one point of this post), but if everyone is capable of using events and a log line is not useful at a fundamental level, it may be worth not logging. However, at that point, then debugging will likely be more difficult without some way for all plugins to capture and preserve and output these events.To the parallelism point in parentheses above, I think things can be logged into some sidecar log file, but I (again) don't know if that addresses the points made in quisquous' second post. Anyway, this is all to say I think it's somewhat nebulous and unless the tooling gets a lot better for the average user to create support files for debugging I think most things will default to being logged. Which then leads to, maybe implement the least amount upfront and try to peel off things one at a time. In this same vein, I would also say anything that grows sublinearly with log amounts is probably also \"okay\" here; for example, if there were a log line added at the start of every instance to calculate the random offset for items and head markers, since that could then be used in the logic of other callouts (or maybe eventually just fix all of the head markers in their log lines -- going back to the accessibility point above).

That's one of the biggest advantages of events over log lines IMO (or at the very least, is a reason to do both in those circumstances, like for map/zone/party changes).Also, something that I don't think is talked about is the sheer variance in number of log lines simply due to a user's battle log settings (or whether they have the \"hide chat log for privacy\" setting enabled). A simple cast/snapshot/resolve goes from 3 lines to 6 if the relevant battle log options are enabled. I think it's probably fine to tell someone \"hey, if you're seeing your parsing lag behind, turn off unused battle log stuff as a workaround\". You've also got some plugins dumping their debug log as fake echo chat lines, which would have a disproportionate impact on performance because any regex/parsing looking for echo lines will have to process further into the line before throwing it out.

At the same time, they're driven by log lines in the first place, so in most of these cases, the answer is \"do both options\". I'd advocate for that, since it still works if you open a plain log file.But I still think it is a good idea to have an \"enhanced log\" format that captures websocket data rather than just log lines. As I mentioned earlier, some triggers require accurate combatants data to function correctly (even if the log line itself has stale data), meaning you need a capture of that data for them to be properly testable. I do this anyway because sometimes there's even more data sources needed for an accurate reconstruction (e.g. I currently need Telesto for a properly sorted party list). All reactions"

It's still better to have it cached than not cached, since it's only used to improve a UI view.But again, I don't think these are necessarily mutually exclusive. It's really more of a 3-way choice - line, event, or both.

                "content": "For whatever it's worth here's my opinion on the matter and my intentions when I implemented the event sources in the first place:I don't like log lines as a data transport because they often have way too much overhead. Most overlays that subscribe to log lines only use a small fraction of the lines. For all the ignored lines, we're wasting CPU time with JSON serialisation and IPC (C# -> C++ -> sandbox -> JS) and lines that are used still waste CPU time because each overlay does its own log parsing so in extreme cases the same line gets parsed 10 times (since 10 different overlays use the same log line).Event sources and events in general were supposed to solve this issue by moving the whole parsing out of JS and making subscriptions more granular. My goal was to eventually phase out log lines for overlays entirely (and offering the same data through events instead) but I doubt this is possible since there will always be overlays that use log lines even if all the data they need is available through events.The only reason I see to generate new log lines in OverlayPlugin would be to make additional data available to other plugins like Triggernometry.This is a curious example because I believe that we could currently support \"lines\" like these for triggers without ever writing them to file, by invoking advancedcombattracker.com/apidoc/html/M_Advanced_Combat_Tracker_FormActMain_ParseRawLogLine.htm, which is maybe a whole other discussion.This is exactly what I did in that case:OverlayPlugin/OverlayPlugin.Core/Integration/UnstableNewLogLines.csLines 113 to 121in9b2a5df public void WriteLogMessage(string msg){var time = DateTime.Now;var lineParts = new string[] { \"00\", time.ToString(), \"c0fe\", \"\", \"OPLine: \" + msg, \"\" };var line = string.Join(\"|\", lineParts); ActGlobals.oFormActMain.ParseRawLogLine(false, time, line);logQueue?.Enqueue(line);} Something else I wanted to do with UnstableNewLogLines is log raw data that is used to generate events which could then be used to replay those events with a log but I never got around to that.Regarding missed log lines: This is an issue that affects both WS clients and normal overlays. The FFXIV plugin starts emitting log lines during start up which in extreme cases can lead to OverlayPlugin itself missing log lines since they're emitted before it even registers the event listener. Even if OverlayPlugin is registered in time to catch the log lines, the overlay might still be loading and thus miss the log line as well.With cached events, subscribing to an event immediately triggers the event using the cached value for the given subscriber which makes the whole thing pretty seamless (since the overlay can't tell if the event was created using cached data or not).Regarding performance:OverlayPlugin itself is pretty light on CPU load since it doesn't really do much with log lines. Most of the time is spent on JSON serialisation and in Chromium code (which has to hand off the message to the actual renderer process).Often, when someone complained about performance issues on the ACT Discord, Triggernometry's benchmark showed that their many triggers took 0.3s per log line or something like that. Sometimes the cause were the Hojoring plugins as well (due to either being slow, doing too much on the log parsing thread or spamming log lines).If you're curious, enable log line processing during imports in OverlayPlugin's settings, attach VS' profiler to the ACT process and import a log. At the very least, your DPS overlays should be updating during the log import. During the log import, check if any overlay is falling behind the other overlays. Once the import is done, check the output from the VS profiler. If you want to measure JS performance, you can also use the JS profiler in DevTools. All reactions"

However, the next version will make this much easier:If the automated download fails, the OverlayPlugin.dll tab will show this tab. The Please wait... text is just a placeholder which will contain the appropriate download link. The user would click that link and once the file is downloaded, they click the button below, select the downloaded file and OverlayPlugin takes care of the rest.If possible, can you separate the CEF package into another git?My program gets the JSON data from github api.The format must always be the same to get the data of latest version .I'm not sure if moving that package into another repo would help. You can just loop over the available releases for this repo and look for files starting with CefSharp- and you'll be able to find the latest CEF package. Once you have the latest release, you still have to figure out if you want to download the x86 or x64 version which depends on whether the user is using the DirectX11 or DirectX9 version of FFXIV.I might have to change the file extension soon since a few users were surprised by the .DO_NOT_DOWNLOAD part. I'll change that to .CefBundle with the next update.That said, you can always find the download URL and expected version in OverlayPlugin.Updater/CefInstaller.cs.Also, Do you plan to support the features of ACTWebsocket such as Capture and AppRegion ?MopiMopi specifically requires the AppRegion feature.I can implement the Capture feature fairly easily but I'm not sure about the AppRegion feature.

I think in general positions are often reliable in 03 lines. I would be curious if there's a setpos/move in the cases where it feels like it's spawn (somewhere random) -> move -> starts casting (incorrect stale log line position) vs whether SpawnNPC had the right data but the 03 log line did not. If SpawnObject means \"towers\", then that'd probably be quite useful.It's unlikely that we would get bad position data in 03 lines just because of the way that they work (completely memory-based and only emitted when the actor is visible, which should always be after their ActorSetPos packet has been handled client-side). However, the fact that they're memory-based and therefore dependent on polling rate makes them significantly slower in some cases than SpawnXYZ packets, though for many mechanics the actor exists from the start of the fight instead of being spawned mid-fight.\"Objects\" in this case are extremely simplified actors that will never generate e.g. a Cast line. They're more akin to housing items in their level of functionality, though they do exist in instanced battle content. I included them in the list since they also exist in the Combatants array in-memory.Re: party lines. I think if we have a working version right now that is not opcode based, then I think we should probably stick with it unless there's a good reason to switch. The existing version sounds more reliable, and I don't see the advantage to switching here.The maintainability is roughly equal, e.g. packet layout changing would be equivalent in difficulty to update to memory layout changing.I'm of two minds here because getting cross-world info is a massive pain via memory but would be relatively simple via packet, but then the need for cross-world party list is pretty limited.Re: update hate / update hater. Mostly my feelings are around if this is easier to maintain than the current enmity code.

It's not public more because I am a novice with this stuff and it's not very good code, but also no one has really directly asked for it. Feel free to DM me on Discord.It was basically made by studying Adam's documentation here and then remaking the scripts available here (the sigs are out of date and some other stuff was broken). There's a few other open source projects that I've seen as well that are purely based on sigs rather than comparing schema diffs between two versions. Flawed also posts an opcode diff json on the Sapphire server too that could probably be used.

I have no idea how spammy this is or how often it happens. (At least in one pull of criterion, it literally only happens in these cases.) It looks like the first set of bombs likely sets this animation state in the npc spawn packet so we could emit that line too, but that's maybe risky for the future if we don't have any other easier-to-test examples and it's less important than the later sets.Edit: Also, is BattleTalk2 the 0044 battle dialog?

Here's some bomb spawning with offsets (Hx### = header, 0x### = packet offset, so add 0x20 to get the real offset). NE is the glowing initial bomb. If you diff the two files, you can see that 0x90 aka 0xB0 offset is (probably) the initial animation state, but it was unclear to me how big it is.

The only thing that's always available is memory data since that's read constantly. Log and network based data are only available once OverlayPlugin has seen the relevant packets / log lines.I could add a disclaimer that some data might be missing until you change your zone if you start ACT after FFXIV though I'm not sure where I'd put that disclaimer (in the dev docs? The UI?). I'm not really willing to change this either since it's a natural consequence of the parser design and will always remain an issue as long as we rely on raw network data anywhere.

Finally, there's nothing I can do to fix the OnlineStatusChanged event but I doubt anyone cares about that (since it's mostly used for cutscene detection).If I register the PartyChangeDelegate early, loading OverlayPlugin after the FFXIV plugin becomes a hard requirement but most people seem to do that anyway. I can probably display a warning if I detect that OverlayPlugin is loaded before the FFXIV plugin to work around that issue.I'll probably have to split the load phases, then. The FFXIV integration has to be enabled early so we can register the PartyChangeDelegate but the Trigg integration has to be enabled late because I can't rely on people loading Trigg before OverlayPlugin. Nothing uses the Trigg integration directly so that should be fine.To register the event handlers, it's enough to create the event source instances early, I don't have to start them so it shouldn't mess with other stuff like the config UI.This wouldn't cause Cactbot's own event source to start any earlier but I don't think it's affected because it doesn't listen to any ACT or FFXIV events in the first place.

You can't expect overlays to update whenever there's a change to the JS API. In general, the main reason for the script was to act as a wrapper around whatever browser runtime OverlayPlugin uses, just in case I'd have to switch it (again). Thankfully, that never happened and there were never any significant changes to the script and by now the point is probably moot.Assuming the internal JS API (specifically the window.OverlayPluginApi object and window.__OverlayCallback) won't change in the near future, the best path forward (IMO anyway) would be to talk with the devs for the existing NPM package and improve the type definitions. Generating the event structs from C# sounds nice but I have no idea how hard that would be to setup or maintain. All reactions"
